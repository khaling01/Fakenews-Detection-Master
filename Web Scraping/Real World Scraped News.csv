Ukraine war: Kyiv's allies pledge more weapons to help win war,"Ukraine war: Kyiv's allies pledge more weapons to help win war Ukraine's allies have pledged to send more weapons to help it defend against a renewed Russian offensive. The US and others vowed to send artillery, anti-tank and air defence aid to Kyiv during a 90-minute video call on Tuesday.  Ukraine says it needs the weapons to help defend itself as Russia launched a new campaign in the country's east. Clashes there have marked what Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky said was the start of the ""battle for the Donbas"".  The eastern Donbas - which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - is where Russia is concentrating its efforts.  According to Ukraine, Russian forces have been attacking Ukrainian positions along the entire 300-mile (480km) front line since Monday. It was amid these renewed attacks that Western leaders met to discuss further military assistance for Ukraine. Following the meeting, the US defence department said additional military aircraft and aircraft parts had been sent to Ukraine to increase their fleet size and repair others in Ukraine's arsenal that were damaged. The US defence department added that the US had not provided aircraft to Kyiv itself, and did not provide details on which countries have provided the aircraft. President Zelensky has been appealing to the US for Soviet-made air defence systems and fighter jets as an alternative to a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Last month, the US refused a proposal by Poland to provide it with MiG-29 fighter jets, which it would then transfer to Ukraine. President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters after the meeting between Western allies, added that the US is planning to provide a further military aid package to Ukraine of a similar size to the $800m (£615m) aid package he announced last week, according to US media. He said Washington would also be sending Ukraine more artillery - heavy guns deployed in land warfare. Other countries also pledged to help Ukraine with further military assistance during the meeting. ""They [Ukraine] need support with more artillery, that is what we will be giving them,"" said the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in parliament after the meeting. In Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany was providing finance to enable Ukraine to buy anti-tank weapons and ammunition from German arms manufacturers.  Meanwhile, the Czech Republic said it would repair Ukrainian tanks and armoured vehicles when they are damaged in combat. Further economic sanctions against Russia was another topic on the agenda. The arms pledges follow persistent calls from President Zelensky for allies to increase their weapons supplies to Kyiv. ""We need heavy artillery, armed vehicles, air defence systems and combat aircraft — anything to repel Russian forces and stop their war crimes,"" Mr Zelensky said on Twitter last week. ""Nobody will stop Russia except Ukraine with heavy weapons"". Russia fiercely opposes such assistance. ""The United States and Western states under its control are doing everything to drag out the military operation for as long as possible,"" Russia's defence chief Sergei Shoigu said. The leaders also discussed how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine after the war even if it is not a member of Nato, a French presidential advisor said. Nato is a military alliance whose 30 members - including the US, UK and Germany - have agreed to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any one of them. Since Ukraine is not a Nato member, the alliance isn't obliged to come to its defence.  Its members fear that involving themselves in direct armed confrontation could lead to an all-out conflict between Russia and the West. Instead, Nato members have supplied Ukraine with millions of dollars worth of military aid since Russia launched the invasion. This video can not be played Finland to decide on Nato bid in weeks, says PM What is Nato and how is it helping Ukraine?"
Sri Lanka crisis: One killed after police fire live bullets at protesters,"Sri Lanka crisis: One killed after police fire live bullets at protesters Outrage has erupted over the death of a Sri Lankan man who was killed when police fired live bullets at protesters, also injuring 14 others. Footage of police opening fire in the central town of Rambukkana has been widely shared on social media. Police said they used ""minimum force"" to  disperse protesters, but many have asked why live bullets were used.  The incident has been condemned by the UN representative to Sri Lanka as well as the US and EU envoys. It comes as the nation is grappling with its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.  Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets since Sri Lanka ran out of money for vital imports which has seen the prices of essential commodities skyrocket and caused acute shortages of fuel, medicines and electricity. Protesters are demanding the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa as they blame his policies for the crisis, but he is refusing to quit. Mr Rajapaksa admitted that he made several ""mistakes"" that contributed to the situation, but his appointment of a new cabinet on Monday angered many Sri Lankans. There were protests in a number of areas on Tuesday after Sri Lanka's main fuel retailer put prices up by nearly 65%. The prices of essential food items like wheat flour also increased on Tuesday. The crowds in Rambukkana had been protesting for about 15 hours demanding fuel, BBC Sinhala's Ranga Sirilal reports. Thousands of angry motorists and bus drivers were also burning tyres and blocking the nearby highway linking the capital Colombo with the city of Kandy. At least three of the injured protesters are said to be in a critical condition. The man who died was likely to have been shot, Mihiri Priyangani, director of the Kegalle Teaching Hospital, told Reuters news agency.  ""We are suspecting gunshot injuries but need a post-mortem to confirm the exact cause of death."" ""Police had to fire to control the protesters. They set fire to some tyres too, so police had to fire to disperse them,"" police spokesman Nihal Talduwa told the BBC. The authorities say the crowd threw stones and other objects at police, injuring a number of them but many are asking why live bullets were deemed to be an appropriate response. Why was live ammunition fired against unarmed civilians? The Law & Order Minister must immediately issue instructions to Police to ensure that such violence is not unleashed on peaceful protestors across the island. I strongly condemn the use of excessive force! #Rambukkana #LKA The Inspector General of Police CD Wickramaratne later issued a statement saying that police had acted to stop a group of protesters from setting fire to a truck containing 30,000 litres of fuel. This has been disputed by protesters, while many on social media have pointed out that video of the incident shows no such threat to the truck.  Footage from other parts of the country showing police beating and firing tear gas at protesters have also caused massive outrage.  The US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, has called for a ""full, transparent investigation"" into the violence, adding that ""the people's right to peaceful protest must be upheld"".  The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa who swept into power in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Critics say corruption and nepotism - his brothers and nephews occupied several key ministerial portfolios - are the main reasons for the crisis. His new cabinet contained several party stalwarts, but was shorn of Rajapaksa family members, apart from the president's elder brother Mahinda who kept his job as prime minister. The latest incident came as Sri Lankan officials headed to the IMF requesting urgent financial help. Beleaguered Sri Lanka leader appoints new cabinet Why are there mass protests in Sri Lanka? No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system"
Gotabaya Rajapaksa: Beleaguered Sri Lanka leader appoints new cabinet,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa: Beleaguered Sri Lanka leader appoints new cabinet Beleaguered Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has appointed a new cabinet despite calls for him to resign over a disastrous economic crisis. The 17 new ministers named did not include several relatives who had previously held portfolios, although a number of stalwarts kept their seats. He had called on the opposition to join a unity government but they refused.  The island nation is grappling with its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.  It is caused in part by a lack of foreign currency, which has meant that Sri Lanka cannot afford to pay for imports of staple foods and fuel, leading to acute shortages and very high prices.  With power cuts lasting half a day or more, and shortages of food, medicines and fuel, public anger has soared. Last week, Sri Lanka also said it would temporarily default on its foreign debts. A payment on some of those bond debts was due to be made on Monday, the day on which the government is to begin bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund.  The stock exchange has also been suspended for a week with effect from Monday. Mass protests began in early April with people calling for President Rajapaksa to quit. His cabinet resigned en masse but he refused to go, despite the opposition arguing that he had lost the people's mandate. His appointment of a new cabinet appears to be another sign that he will not bend to protesters' demands.  It also comes hours after some media outlets sympathetic to his government labelled peaceful protests in the capital ""a beach party"", and implied that they were funded by terror organisations. The protests in Colombo's Galle Face Green have attracted thousands of people. When the protests broke out, Mr Rajapaksa activated a draconian emergency law and imposed a curfew to try to stop them. He also banned social media.  He later withdrew these measures when they failed to deter protesters.  Both he and his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was not among those who resigned and who keeps his post in the new cabinet, have addressed the nation in an apparent attempt to placate protesters. But calls for the president to resign have only grown louder.  The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa who swept into power with a thumping majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Critics say rank corruption and nepotism - his brothers and nephews occupied several key ministerial portfolios - are the main reasons for the situation the country has found itself in. Opulent displays of wealth by family members have only increased anger. Significantly, there are no Rajapaksa family members in the new cabinet, apart from the prime minister. Four ministers, including Finance Minister Ali Sabry and Foreign Minister GL Peiris, keep their posts. All 21 positions in the cabinet are filled by men. In the previous cabinet one woman held a ministerial portfolio. Why are there mass protests in Sri Lanka? No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system"
Sri Lanka healthcare on verge of collapse in economic crisis,"Sri Lanka healthcare on verge of collapse in economic crisis By Rajini VaidyanathanBBC South Asia correspondent, Colombo Doctors across Sri Lanka say hospitals are running out of medicines and essential supplies as the country's economic crisis worsens. They fear a health catastrophe if international help doesn't arrive soon. ""Day by day things are running out. If we get to the point where it's zero, then I don't know what will happen,"" says Dr Gnanasekaram anxiously.  As secretary of Sri Lanka's Association of Medical Specialists, the surgeon has been busy compiling lists of which medicines are running low at hospitals in the capital Colombo.  ""We are short of medical drugs, anaesthetic drugs, implants, suture materials. We are nearly exhausting the stock. ""Healthcare services are going to collapse unless there's immediate relief,"" he says.  I meet Dr Gnanasekaram between consultations - he says he's hoping this interview will encourage international donors to come forward.  If supplies aren't replenished soon, the doctor warns of dire consequences.  ""If that happens there may be a situation where we won't be able to save patients' lives."" Sri Lanka is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in history. The country imports around 85% of its medical supplies. But with foreign currency reserves running low, essential drugs are now difficult to obtain.  At his office in Sri Lanka's largest children's hospital, Lady Ridgeway, medical director Dr Wijesuriya shows me a piece of paper with a list of essential drugs on it.  Next to the name of the medicine, there's a column showing availability.  Some like atracurium - used in anaesthetics - have only two months of stock left. But as I scan the list further, other drugs are in even shorter supply.  There's only two weeks left of the painkiller fentanyl, while three different types of antibiotics are already ""out of stock"".  For now Dr Wijesuriya says he's managing these shortages with substitutions. He remains optimistic that the government will find a way to get him what is needed for his patients.  Frontline doctors are far less upbeat. Many say they've been told by the government they can't speak openly to the media about the situation, with only union representatives and hospital directors authorised to do so.  In a statement Sri Lanka's government initially denied medicines were running out, even as doctors reported problems.  A day later the Department of Government Information issued a correction, admitting there is a shortage of some drugs and equipment.  Documents seen by the BBC, interviews with medical unions and testimony from frontline doctors reveal that hospitals across the nation are in desperate need of a range of life-saving drugs and equipment.  Medical staff have told the BBC the crunch in supplies has forced them to suspend non-essential operations, and reuse or ration some equipment.   Dr Nishan (not his real name) works at a cancer hospital in the Eastern province.  ""In two weeks' time we may have to stop most surgeries and only do emergencies,"" he told me as he reeled off a list of essentials like IV fluids, paracetamol, and antibiotics that his team are struggling to get hold of.  ""There may be a time when we have to even stop treating cancer patients,"" he warned.   Dr Nishan is from an area hit hard by the country's civil war. Working as a doctor in conflict has its many challenges, but this economic crisis comes with many others.  ""During the war we had limitations, but we could still get things from the ministry in Colombo,"" he said.  ""But now even the health ministry doesn't have supplies.  During wartime we were not so frustrated and desperate as we are now."" Sri Lanka runs a free national healthcare system, which millions of people on the island rely on. Kasun (not his real name), who works at a hospital in the Southern province, said it's only a matter of days before drugs run out unless supplies come in.  ""We are being told to use what we have sparingly, but there's no real solution. I feel helpless."" The largest doctor's union on the island, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA),  has blamed the crisis on poor financial and economic management and is calling on people from overseas to donate supplies.  It has published an extensive list of items which are desperately needed, which includes antibiotics, paracetamol, blood pressure medicine and anti-depressants.  WhatsApp groups of Sri Lankan doctors around the world are busily trying to source drugs,  as the diaspora pitches in to help at this desperate time.  Dr Saman Kumara, president of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka, recorded a desperate video message last week, pleading for ET tubes to help newborn babies breathe.   ""We have almost used all the stocks and no ET tubes will be available in a few weeks,"" he said. Dr Kumara said he had instructed staff to clean and sterilise tubes in case they needed to be reused.  After his message went out, doctors around the world sprang into action to help.  Within 24 hours, he said he was donated an ""adequate amount""  of ET tubes for his hospital.  But he says other shortages remain, and is working with the Save A Baby charity to help co-ordinate efforts. Dr Anver Hamdani, who was recently appointed by the Sri Lankan health ministry to co-ordinate efforts to keep healthcare services running, told the BBC he and his colleagues are working to overcome the shortages.  He's hoping pledges from overseas governments including a credit line from India, the main supplier of Sri Lanka's medicines, plus donations which are coming in, will prevent the looming crisis.  ""We have to admit this is a challenging period - there is a reasonable amount of shortage of certain things. ""It is not yet under control, it in the process of being controlled,"" he said conceding that once the short term supply problem was fixed, a sustainable financing solution will still need to be found.  Sri Lanka's medical crisis is compounded by the added pressure staff themselves are having to face.  This video can not be played Kasun says workers at his hospital have been told overtime payments will be cut as budgets are strained.  Like millions across the country doctors are struggling to obtain the basics. Many say they are queuing for hours to get fuel for their cars to get to hospital.  ""It's becoming very difficult to live, salaries aren't going up but the cost of living has skyrocketed,"" he said.  As tens of thousands have taken to the streets to protest at rising food and fuel prices, doctors, nurses and medical students have joined the demonstrations.   Back at his office Dr Gnanaksekaran pleaded to the world for help. ""We need supplies to come in whatever form, whether it's another country's government, or an individual donation. ""As professionals we are apolitical, but we are concerned about our patients.  ""We just want to be able to treat them - we don't want them to die."" Why are there mass protests in Sri Lanka? Why are there food queues in this Indian Ocean island? How soaring cost of living is hitting Sri Lanka hard Tear gas and water cannon at Sri Lanka protests Sri Lanka profile"
Democrats scramble to reverse course on COVID restrictions ahead of midterms,"Democrats scramble to reverse course on COVID restrictions ahead of midterms Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., discusses Democrats’ decision to drop mask mandates around the country.  Democrats across the country are scrambling to reverse course on COVID-19 restrictions as this year's midterm elections loom.  With the notable exception of the White House, Democrats at every level are signaling their support for returning to normal as polls show Americans are weary of coronavirus restrictions, which Republican states have largely done away with.  According to a recent poll by Monmouth University, 70% of Americans say it’s time for the country to move on from the pandemic, and a decreasing number of Americans support COVID-related mandates. President Biden’s approval ratings on handling COVID, once a strength, are also now underwater, with 43% approving and 53% disapproving, according to the poll. HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’ Biden has chosen to follow the lead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still recommends universal masking indoors and in schools.  But with the midterms ahead, many Democrats who once led the way in issuing lockdown orders and mandates over the course of the pandemic are easing restrictions in their states in defiance of the administration. Numerous blue state governors this week have announced that they are rolling back coronavirus restrictions, and prominent congressional Democrats have also signaled their support for returning to normal.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that her state will end its COVID-19 mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings but will keep it for schools. Illinois announced the same.  Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said Wednesday his state will end its indoor vaccine-or-mask requirement this week, followed by the school mask mandate in March. Massachusetts, which is generally considered a blue state but has a centrist Republican governor, will end its school mask mandate at the end of the month.  Earlier this week, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware all disclosed plans to join states that have lifted or never had mask requirements for their schools.  Swing states like Michigan, Colorado and Pennsylvania were among the first Democrat-led states to loosen COVID-19 restrictions last year. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is up for reelection this year, implemented some of the strictest COVID-19 orders in the country in 2020, including banning travel between two residences and the selling of non-essential goods. She lifted most of her restrictions last summer and has since pushed vaccinations as the best way to slow the spread.  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is also up for reelection, has taken a similar approach and refused to implement any new mandates. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, who is unable to run again this year, leaving his seat up for grabs, said in December, ""Local municipalities, as you know, I think ought to be free to do with what they want,"" echoing what many Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been vilified for saying for the past two years. Less than a year ago, Biden said the lifting of mask mandates in Republican-led states amounted to ""Neanderthal thinking."" 
      President Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House, Jan. 31, 2022, in Washington.
      (Associated Press) The movement to ""move on"" from the pandemic appears to have sped up in recent days as new coronavirus cases decrease following the omicron variant surge. Also expediting matters: A new Johns Hopkins study saying the lockdowns of 2020 did little to curb the COVID-19 death rate and a new guidance Friday by the CDC saying the popular cloth masks accepted by most mandates are the least effective in preventing the spread. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who barely eked out a win in the reliably blue Garden State in November, was the first to lift his school mask mandate this week after the new CDC guidance, and Democratic governors in California, Delaware, Oregon, Connecticut and New York quickly followed course.  ""We are not going to manage COVID to zero,"" Murphy said Monday on Twitter. ""We have to learn how to live with COVID as we move from a pandemic to an endemic phase of this virus."" 
      New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is seen in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Oct. 28, 2021.
      (Getty Images) ""Our statewide indoor mask requirement will expire on 2/15,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is up for reelection this fall, tweeted Monday. ""Unvaccinated people will still need to wear masks indoors."" ""Oregonians have stepped up during the omicron surge — wearing masks, getting vaccinated and boosted and keeping each other safe,"" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who is unable to run for reelection announced Monday. ""Because of your actions, Oregon will lift mask requirements no later than March 31."" ""We are lifting DE's statewide mask mandate for indoor public settings at 8am on Friday, Feb 11,"" Delaware Gov. John Carney tweeted Monday. ""The mask requirement in K-12 public & private schools and child care facilities expires at 11:59pm on Thursday, March 31."" ""It’s about time to end the statewide school mask mandate and enable each local boards of education to decide what is best for their schools,"" Connecticut Gov. Ted Lamont, who is up for reelection, tweeted Wednesday. ""At this time, we say that it’s the right decision to lift this mandate for indoor businesses and let counties, cities and businesses to make their own decisions on what they want to do with respect to mask or vaccination requirement,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is running to keep the governor's seat, said Wednesday, dropping her state’s ""mask or vax"" mandate for businesses. The shift in Democratic messaging surrounding the pandemic was buoyed in part by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s upset win in Virginia in November. Focus group findings by Third Way, a think tank aligned with Democrats, found that swing voters who voted for Youngkin over Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe were motivated by COVID-19 restrictions and school closures even more so than critical race theory being taught in the classroom, NBC News reported. MSNBC, OTHERS HIT AS ‘HYPOCRITES’ FOR CONTRADICTORY COVERAGE ON YOUNGKIN, MURPHY MASK MANDATE ORDERS House Democrats' reelection arm has picked up on this messaging ahead of the midterms, where Democrats face an uphill battle to hold onto their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate. ""Democrats' plan to fight COVID is working — cases are down & vaccines are widely available,"" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, tweeted Wednesday. ""Now, it's time to give people their lives back. With science as our guide, we're ready to start getting back to normal.""  ""People are ready to pivot"" from the pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday. It’s a stark contrast to what the left was saying just a month ago when Youngkin banned school mask mandates in Virginia. ""Kids will die,"" CNN political pundit Joe Lockhart tweeted three weeks ago.

Russia rejects cease-fire for civilian evacuation amid Eastern Orthodox Holy Week,"Russia rejects cease-fire for civilian evacuation amid Eastern Orthodox Holy Week Bill Hemmer reports on Putin's erratic strategic positioning as they enter a new phase of the Russia-Ukraine war on 'Your World.' Russia rejected a temporary cease-fire in Ukraine that the United Nations secretary general requested for the purpose of civilian evacuation during the Eastern Orthodox Holy Week leading up to Easter. Russia's deputy UN ambassador said the cease-fire request was not sincere and would only provide time to arm Ukrainian soldiers. Dmitry Polyanskiy, the deputy ambassador, told the Security Council Tuesday that the cease-fire requests were ""insincere, and in practice they merely point to an aspiration to provide Kyiv nationalists breathing room to regroup and receive more drones, more antitank missiles and more MANPADS,"" The New York Times reported. ""MANPADS"" refers to man-portable air-defense systems, smaller and more portable surface-to-air missiles. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called for a 4-day ceasefire to allow for evacuations in battle zones and for safe corridors to bring in food and medicine.

Guterres said earlier Tuesday that more than 12 million people in Ukraine needed humanitarian assistance. He predicted that number would rise to 15.7 million, about 40% of all Ukrainians remaining in the country.  Even China, which has not condemned Russia and abstained from votes on resolutions against the aggressor country, said it supported a humanitarian cease-fire.

Russia's rejection also comes after the head of the World Council of Churches reached out to Moscow's Patriarch Kirill, urging him to use his religious authority as the head of Russia's Orthodox Church to call for a cease-fire as Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter this weekend. ""Our humble request to your Holiness in this particular and impossible situation is to intervene and ask publicly for a ceasefire for at least a few hours during the Resurrection service,"" Rev. Ioan Sauca, a Romanian Orthodox priest and acting general secretary of the World Council of Churches, wrote in a letter published Tuesday.

Fox News Poll: Voters want the US to do more to help Ukraine against Russia,"Fox News Poll: Voters want the US to do more to help Ukraine against Russia Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. American voters are closely following news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and want to help.   By a 63-32% margin, voters think the U.S. should be doing more for Ukrainians in their fight against Russia.   Fully 82% are concerned about the invasion and 76% approve of how Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is responding to it.   The new Fox News national survey also finds a growing portion say the Russia-Ukraine conflict matters to life in the United States: 85% feel that way, up from 76% last month. It’s an issue Democrats and Republicans largely agree on: 90% of Democrats and 85% of Republicans think what happens in Ukraine makes a difference here at home, about 8 in 10 Democrats and Republicans approve of Zelenskyy, and two-thirds in each party want to do more for Ukraine.  What do voters mean when they say the U.S. should do more? Large majorities favor continuing strict economic sanctions on Russia (80% favor) and providing additional military equipment to Ukraine (78%).  Smaller numbers, although still majorities, favor easing immigration requirements to the U.S. for Ukrainian refugees (67%), sending additional troops to nearby NATO countries (60%), and creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine (52%).  Voters stop short of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, as twice as many oppose (64%) the idea as favor it (31%).  US SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN SAYS RUSSIA IS COMMITTING WAR CRIMES IN UKRAINE  Here again, there’s generally bipartisan agreement on each of these potential actions -- although there is a partisan gap when it comes to easing immigration requirements for Ukrainian refugees.  That’s favored by 77% of Democrats compared to 59% of Republicans.   Support for additional action doesn’t mean voters aren’t concerned about the potential costs.  Three-quarters worry that supporting Ukraine could result in war between the U.S. and Russia (75%) and that a U.S.-Russia conflict could lead to a nuclear war (73%).   Those concerns limit their desire to help.  While 78% favor providing Ukraine more equipment -- support for giving ""substantial military aid"" stands at only 36% if it risks U.S. war with Russia.   And even as 80% favor economic sanctions against Russia, that falls to 44% if sanctions lead to higher prices and financial hardship for Americans.   One month into the Russian invasion, many voters continue to lack confidence in President Biden’s judgment in a crisis (53%), and over half disapprove of both his handling of Russia (59%) and his response to the invasion (54%).   Despite mostly bipartisan support on policies to respond to Russia, there’s little unity on Biden’s ratings.  Democrats are four times as likely as Republicans to approve of his response to the invasion (72% vs. 17%).   ""Biden’s actions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are mostly in-line with voter preferences,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson whose company Beacon Research conducts the Fox News survey along with Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ""But in the face of inflation and entrenched partisanship at home, that’s not enough, at this point, to improve his overall standing in a meaningful way.""  RUSSIA-UKRAINE: MCCARTHY SAYS EUROPEAN PARTNERS ‘LOOKING FOR SOME LEADERSHIP’ AND ‘NOT GETTING IT’ FROM BIDEN  Currently, 45% of voters approve of Biden’s overall job performance, while 54% disapprove.  Last month, it was 43-56%.  That 2-point increase in approval comes from a doubling among Republicans to 15% -- up from 8% approval in February.  Eighty-two percent of Democrats and 33% of independents approve.  Among those who approve of Biden overall, 80% approve of his response to the invasion of Ukraine.   Two-thirds (66%) disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation -- his worst rating of the issues measured.  About 6 in 10 disapprove of Biden on China (57%), border security (58%), and the economy (59%).   CLICK HERE FOR TOPLINE AND CROSSTABS.  Dealing with coronavirus is Biden’s only net positive rating: 50% approve vs. 48% disapprove. ""Some journalists and pundits have suggested Biden might receive a ratings boost because of what political scientists call the ‘rally around the flag’ effect,"" says Shaw. ""But the ‘rally’ effect occurs after a president commits U.S. forces to a conflict, and that isn’t in play here. Perceptions of Biden in this case are much more tied to whether voters think he is walking that fine line between being tough with Putin and not getting the U.S. into another war."" Veterans are more likely than other voters to approve of Zelenskyy (by 7 points), think the U.S. should be doing more for Ukraine (+8), and favor sending more troops to nearby NATO countries (+8).  They are less likely to favor creating a no-fly zone over Ukraine (-9), and to think U.S. support could lead to war between the U.S. and Russia (-7) or nuclear war (-9). CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Conducted March 18-21, 2022 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,004 registered voters nationwide who were randomly selected from a national voter file and spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.

Elon Musk reportedly setting up move for Twitter within 10 days,"Elon Musk reportedly setting up move for Twitter within 10 days  House Oversight and Reform Committee member Michael Cloud discusses censorship of conservatives on 'The Evening Edit.' Tesla CEO Elon Musk is willing to invest up to $15 billion of his own cash to take Twitter private and will make a bid within 10 days, according to Tuesday reports.  The New York Post reported Tuesday that Musk, with a 9.1% stake in the social media company, has tapped Morgan Stanley to help raise an additional $10 billion.  CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk speaks at the Tesla Giga Texas manufacturing ""Cyber Rodeo"" grand opening party in Austin, Texas, on April 7, 2022.  (SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images) Musk’s massive $43 billion bid to purchase the company – or $54.20 per share – may require borrowing against both the company and his stock in addition to raising money from private equity investors, The Post reported, citing two sources close to the situation.  The estimated $10 to $15 billion Musk is reportedly willing to invest is well above his roughly $3.4 billion stake in the company.  The sources told The Post that the co-investors will collectively have more equity in Twitter, but Musk will remain the single largest shareholder.  ELON MUSK TWEETS HIS PHILOSOPHY ON SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY AMID BID TO BUY TWITTER The co-investors will reportedly finance a hostile tender directly to Twitter shareholders, which happens when an outside investor’s ambitions to take over another company do not have management’s approval or blessing.  Musk will launch the tender officer within roughly 10 days, according to The Post. It remains to be seen how successful Musk will be in raising the necessary cash, as his propensity for controversy has turned off some investors.  In this photo illustration the logo of Twitter can be seen on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images / Getty Images) Last week, Twitter adopted a measure known as a ""poison pill,"" which refers to a tactic that companies employ to block an investor from accumulating a majority stake in a company.  If any shareholder accumulates a 15% stake in the company in a purchase not approved by the board of directors, other shareholders will get the right to buy additional shares at a discount diluting the roughly 9.1% stake Musk recently purchased.  For Musk’s bid to be successful, he would need to win full approval from a majority of Twitter shareholders.  DESANTIS LOOKS TO HOLD TWITTER BOARD ‘ACCOUNTABLE’ FOR RESPONSE TO MUSK'S BUYOUT BID FOX Business has reached out to Musk for comment but did not hear back before publication. Twitter declined to comment.  Twitter is leaving open the possibility of negotiating with Musk or another suitor. In a regulator filing on Monday, Twitter’s board says the shareholder rights agreement should not interfere with any merger or offer approved by the board.

He could raise money by borrowing billions using his stakes in Tesla and SpaceX as collateral, and he could bring in other investors. The poison pill would give stockholders as of April 25 the right to buy one one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock for each common share they own, at a price of $210. The rights are triggered if any person or group of investors buys 15% or more of the company's shares without board approval.

"Pressure builds for Biden, Democrats to move past COVID","Pressure builds for Biden, Democrats to move past COVID Americans remain deeply divided on what it means to 'live with the virus.'  On Location: April 18, 2022 It's a move that would have been unthinkable last year: Weeks after a holiday surge crushed hospitals and more people died in a single month than a typical annual flu season, four Democratic governors this week declared an end date to statewide mask mandates in schools. The new changes won't take effect for several weeks. Gov. Ned Lamont's Connecticut mandate will expire Feb. 28,  followed by New Jersey on March 7, and Oregon and Delaware on March 31 -- presumably after the omicron wave has ended and case counts are low. Their decisions also leave local school districts the option of keeping their mandates in place. Still, the message from the Democratic governors to President Joe Biden was unmistakable: With the midterms nine months away, Democrats are now joining the chorus of Republicans who say the nation must learn to ""live with the virus"" and are pressing Biden to chart a path forward. ""Democratic voters have run out of empathy for unvaccinated people dying of COVID,"" said Brian Stryker, a partner at Impact Research, a Democratic polling firm. ""They are ready to live their lives."" If 2021 was the year of the vaccine, 2022 is already shaping up to be the year voters demand the U.S. moves on. For health experts, living with COVID means paying attention to local case counts and ""dialing"" up or down restrictions as needed. It also means taking steps to protect people who are immunocompromised and are at higher risk for breakthrough cases, as well as children under the age of 5 who still don't qualify for a vaccine. For many Americans, though, including a growing number of Democratic voters, living with COVID means loosening restrictions regardless of case counts or vaccination status. According to a new Axios/Ipsos poll, two-thirds of Americans say they do not believe it's possible for the U.S. to eradicate the coronavirus within the next year, although they are divided about how to handle that. That reality puts unique pressure on Biden ahead of his State of the Union address on March 1 -- a speech typically used by sitting presidents to declare victory and look toward the future. ""The public is saying 'enough.' The politicians are saying 'enough,'"" said Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster and strategist. ""If Biden doesn't say 'enough' at the SOTU, he'll be digging a hole he can't climb out. The (Democratic) governors know this because they're closer to the people,"" he wrote in an email to ABC News. A Democratic official familiar with the thinking of the governors said they have been talking for a while now about offering COVID-wary Americans a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" after the omicron wave -- and pressing the White House to do the same in Biden's upcoming national address. ""The governors are acutely aware that there's a need to provide people some optimism and give people some sense of 'here's the path forward,'"" said the official, who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity in order to speak more openly. ""They want him to talk about his wins, and there are good ones to talk about"" like job growth and infrastructure investments that aren't COVID related, the person said. Biden's initial plan to liberate Americans from the pandemic by last Fourth of July centered on vaccinations and ensuring widespread and equitable access. Eventually, he turned to workplace mandates. Yet one year later, tens of millions of eligible Americans remain unvaccinated and his mandates for large businesses have been scuttled by the Supreme Court. COVID hospitalizations and deaths also have eclipsed any comparisons to the flu. For example, more than 60,000 people died from complications of COVID in January alone -- one of the highest monthly COVID-19 death tolls on record. By comparison, a typical flu season might result in 20,000 to 50,000 deaths in an entire year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. in the last week averaged about 614 new cases a day per 100,000 residents -- 61 times what the CDC considers to be low transmission. The CDC still recommends masks indoors, including in schools, for people ages 2 and up. ""I'm sure they're facing a lot of pressure, both internally and externally, to try to make sure the pandemic is over,"" Andy Slavitt, a former Biden adviser on COVID, said on ABC's ""Start Here"" podcast of the Democratic governors. ""It's just not quite clear that it is."" While the Democratic governors insist public health remains the priority, it's hard to ignore this week's rollbacks as a political calculation as Democrats look toward the midterm elections. Connecticut's Lamont is up for reelection this fall. Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown's term limit expires this fall, leaving her seat up for grabs. In New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Philip Murphy is coming off a narrow victory last fall, a race that surprised many pundits by how close it was. Also worth noting was Republican Glenn Youngkin's victory in Virginia last fall, flipping enough Democratic voters to win the governor's race there by promising to keep schools open and empower parents to make education decisions. Celinda Lake, a Democratic strategist and lead pollster for Biden in the 2020 presidential election, said she thinks the move by governors is a gamble. If cases rise, they might have to go back to the public to ask for restrictions to be imposed again. Also, she notes, overall polling in the country still suggests strong support among Americans for masks in schools, with moms and women in particular erring on the side of caution. So Biden will have to take into account that majority of voters when addressing the nation, even if they aren’t as vocal, she said. ""People are looking for certainty. They're looking for consistent leadership. They're looking for clear criteria. And yes, they express short term frustration and fatigue. But steady leadership is going to beat (going) up and down and going back and forth,"" she said. Stryker said he still thinks the goal -- at least from a political standpoint -- is to move away from talking about the pandemic as much as Democrats are. ""If Democrats can stop talking about COVID every day, treat it like the long-term problem it is and start talking about more immediate concerns of voters"" like the high cost of living, ""the better they will do in the midterms,"" he said. Arielle Mitropoulos contributed to this report."
DOJ says it will appeal mask mandate decision if CDC calls for it,"DOJ says it will appeal mask mandate decision if CDC calls for it A ruling on Monday voided the mask mandate on public transit. New mask guidance leaves millions navigating changed rules The Department of Justice announced Tuesday night it would appeal the recent ruling that voided the federal mask mandate on public transit if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deems it necessary. The question now is whether the CDC still thinks the mandate on public transit is an important public health tool, a decision it stood behind just last week when it extended the mandate until May 3 to monitor an uptick in cases from the BA.2 variant, a more transmissible strain of omicron. And if the CDC does move to reimpose the mandate, it's unclear whether action from the Justice Department will lead to change before the mandate was set to expire anyway. ""The Department of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) disagree with the district court's decision and will appeal, subject to CDC's conclusion that the order remains necessary for public health,"" the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday. ""If CDC concludes that a mandatory order remains necessary for the public's health after that assessment, the Department of Justice will appeal the district court's decision."" The CDC, for its part, responded later Tuesday night and said that it was still assessing the need for a mask requirement. ""CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in all indoor public transportation settings. We will continue to assess the need for a mask requirement in those settings, based on several factors, including the U.S. COVID-19 community levels, risk of circulating and novel variants, and trends in cases and disease severity,"" the CDC said. The decision on Monday made by a Florida judge appointed by former President Donald Trump struck down a federal mask mandate that applied to public transportation, effectively lifting the requirement on planes, trains and buses, as well as inside airports across the United States. In the ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Mizelle said the mandate, established by the CDC, exceeds ""statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the [Administrative Procedure Act]."" The judge's decision was effective immediately. Though the federal government was expected to appeal the decision, neither President Joe Biden nor White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated which way the DOJ was leaning until the announcement on Tuesday evening. The issue of masking is a political lightning rod ahead of the midterm elections and one the administration has not sought to aggressively fight since mask mandates have already been lifted in much of the country. Late Monday night, an administration official said only that the Transportation Security Administration would no longer enforce the requirement to wear masks on public transportation but that the CDC continued to recommend them. The fallout of the court decision left Americans with a patchwork of rules: fly without a mask in and out of New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy airports but put one on while walking through the airports, for example. Meanwhile, Amtrak and ride-share services like Uber and Lyft have dropped their mask rules, but several major cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco still require them on some public transportation. Last month, CEOs of all the major U.S. airlines wrote to the Biden administration asking for an end to the mask requirements on planes. ""It makes no sense that people are still required to wear masks on airplanes, yet are allowed to congregate in crowded restaurants, schools and at sporting events without masks, despite none of these venues having the protective air filtration system that aircraft do,"" the business executives wrote. The group said the burden of enforcing the mask mandate has fallen on their employees. ""This is not a function they are trained to perform and subjects them to daily challenges by frustrated customers. This in turn takes a toll on their own well-being."" There have been 1,150 reports of unruly passengers on flights this year -- 744 of which involved face coverings, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

"Russian offensive 'limited' so far, fall of Mariupol 'not inevitable': Pentagon update Day 55","Russian offensive 'limited' so far, fall of Mariupol 'not inevitable': Pentagon update Day 55 The moves are a ""prelude"" to larger operations, a U.S. defense official said. Russia declares new phase of its ‘special operation’ underway The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the U.S. assessment of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist. Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Tuesday on Day 55. 'Limited' Russian offensive operations so far in eastern Ukraine The U.S. has seen ""limited"" Russian offensive operations southwest of Donetsk and south of Izium, but these are believed to be ""preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""These are actual ground offensives, and they are being supported, of course, by some long-range fires, mostly artillery, which is right out of the Russian doctrine,"" the official said. But while there is ongoing fighting in the region, a more devastating offensive is still in the works. ""You've seen comments by [Ukraine's] President Zelenskyy yesterday, and even for [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov, about this new offensive beginning ... We think that these ... are preludes to larger offensive operations that the Russians plan to conduct. So, we're not pushing back on the notion that offensive operations have begun, but again, we think that this is a prelude of larger offensive operations that are potentially still in the offing here,"" the official said. The Pentagon believes Russia's military is working to learn from its mistakes fighting in the north, where it was plagued with logistical and supply problems, conducting what officials call ""shaping operations"" to set favorable conditions on the battlefield before beginning its new offensive in earnest. ""In other words, continue to reinforce, continue to make sure they have logistics and sustainment in place, continue to make sure that they have proper aviation and other enabling capability,"" the official said. Over the last 24 hours, two Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs), or up to 2,000 more combat troops, have been sent into Ukraine, according to the official. This brings the total to an estimated 78 BTGs inside the country, all in the south and east. About 75% of Putin's total combat power originally arrayed against Ukraine remains, according to the official. This takes into account all military capabilities, including troop casualties, destroyed vehicles and aircraft, and expended missiles. This is the lowest assessment we've heard out of the Pentagon. Fall of Mariupol and Donbas 'not inevitable'  ""People speak about this as if it's inevitable, that Mariupol is going to fall, that it's inevitable that Donbas will be taken by the Russians. We don't see it that way. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that it's not inevitable,"" the official said. With fighting concentrated around Donbas, Ukraine has to move aid coming in from the U.S. and others all the way across the country. ""Right now we know from our discussions with the Ukrainians that they are getting this materiel, it's getting into the hands of their fighters,"" the official said. But Russia aims to isolate Ukrainian forces in the east. ""Clearly what the Russians want to do is cut them off and to defeat them in the Donbas,"" the official said, reiterating that defeat is not inevitable. Ukraine has more operable planes than 2 weeks ago At a separate briefing later Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine currently has more operable military planes right now than it did two weeks ago because Ukraine has received additional aircraft as well as parts to get damaged planes flying again. Kirby was reticent to provide any details on where the parts and planes came from but stressed that they did not come from the U.S. ""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby said at the on-camera briefing at the Pentagon. “And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who had experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get more aircraft up and running,” said Kirby. ""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said. Russian missile strikes The U.S. assesses Russia has fired at least 1,670 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion. The official noted that bad weather lowers visibility, making it harder for the U.S. to observe launches and other battlefield actions, so the actual number could be higher. Despite the recent airstrikes in Kyiv and Lviv, Russia's firepower is focused on Mariupol and Donbas."
Pakistan ‘inches away’ from civil unrest after ousting of Imran Khan,"Pakistan ‘inches away’ from civil unrest after ousting of Imran Khan Former PM is accused of creating wave of public anger that could prove difficult to control On Tuesday, two days after Imran Khan had been ousted as Pakistan’s prime minister in a dramatic no-confidence vote, Noor Alam Khan – a politician and former member of Khan’s party – was eating dinner at a restaurant when he was confronted by another diner. The man began shouting “traitor”, “American agent” and “turncoat” and then lunged over to punch Khan, who had been attempting to ignore him. In the middle of the restaurant, the politician and the angry voter began to brawl, with food and tables going flying. For Noor Khan, who was among the dozens of members of Imran Khan’s supporters who recently switched sides and voted against him in the no-confidence vote, the incident was the culmination of mounting abuse he has faced in recent weeks from the former prime minister’s supporters. “I have been harassed and faced death threats since I announced that I would vote against Imran Khan in the no-confidence vote,” he said. “I have received phone calls saying: we will kill you and your children like Benazir Bhutto [former prime minister who was assassinated] because you are an American agent and betrayed prime minister Imran Khan.” Similar chaos ensued on Saturday at a gathering of the Punjab assembly meant to be discussing the election of a new chief minister , as supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and opposition lawmakers began to aggressively confront each other and the deputy speaker, Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari, was attacked by members of the treasury benches. In a tweet after the incident, Khan’s former information minister and close ally Fawad Chaudhry tweeted that Pakistan was “inches away from fully fledged civil unrest”. “Imran Khan has exercised utmost restraint,” he said. “Very soon even he won’t be able to stop this very angry mob and we’ll see the country plunging into a civil unrest.” Khan, Pakistan’s premier cricketer turned pious Islamist prime minister, was elected in 2018 on a wave of populist sentiment, speaking out against the west and Pakistan’s powerful political dynasties, who had been shrouded in corruption allegations. But while his charisma and populist rhetoric never failed to pull in the crowds at rallies, he also oversaw a period of huge financial turmoil and massive inflation that devastated the economy. After losing the support of the powerful military, the opposition moved in with a no-confidence vote, backed by many from Khan’s own coalition who had lost faith in the prime minister. Shehbaz Sharif, the leader of the opposition coalition and brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was elected by the national assembly to succeed him. But the removal of Khan has in no way led to the demise of the populist politics he fostered while in office. Many fear that the deep polarisation cultivated by Khan could prove deeply destabilising for Pakistan, pushing the country into greater political turmoil that the new prime minister, who is known more for his skills as an administrator than a charismatic leader, might be unable to contain. In recent days, the inflammatory rallying cry of Khan, who has gone back out on the campaign trail with gusto, has been “ghaddari” – traitors – with anyone opposing him, be it his political parties, the media, activists, intellectuals and the judiciary being tarnished as part of a “foreign conspiracy” to oust him. Pervez Hoodbhoy, an analyst who has extensively written on Khan, called the former prime minister “a true populist”. “Khan has polarised Pakistan to such an extreme level,” said Hoodbhoy. “The coming days will be chaotic as his insatiable lust for power makes him truly dangerous for this country.” Evoking popular anti-western sentiment that he has played on for the past four years in office, Khan has continued to push the narrative that the no-confidence vote which ousted him was a “foreign conspiracy” by the west, citing diplomatic correspondence with the US to prove it. The US vehemently denied it and no definitive proof of a conspiracy has been shown. In a rare press conference on Thursday, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, the spokesperson of the armed forces, dismantled Khan’s narrative and rejected the claim that a diplomatic cable contained evidence of foreign interference. Iftikhar, referring to the diplomatic communication, said: “Is there any word such as conspiracy used in it? I think not.” He also clarified that the US never asked for army bases in Pakistan, something Imran khan used as “evidence” of why the US wanted him to be ousted. Yet the stance of the military establishment, which wields huge power in the country, has also made its members targets of a social media campaign led by Khan’s supporters, who see the army as having played a role in the prime minister’s fall from power. Tens of thousands of tweets have been sent in recent days criticising the army. On Wednesday, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested 12 social media activists who reportedly ran these campaigns, which Iftikhar called “illegal, immoral and against national interest”. On the streets of cities and towns across Pakistan, the narrative that Khan was victim to a western conspiracy has been powerful and pervasive, and thousands have continued to come out in protest in support of him. Addressing a huge crowd on Wednesday, Khan said that a decisive moment had arrived, and the nation needed to choose if it wanted “slavery or liberty” from the US. Khan accused the opposition leaders of being an “imported government” who are “slaves of the US” and said he and his supporters would be on the streets until fresh elections were announced. Muhammad Banaras, 35, a resident in Islamabad, said Khan was the first prime minister to “think about the poor and challenge the corrupt”. “Khan has talked about Islam, the rights of Kashmiris and against corruption. The west and the US are against him, they don’t want Pakistan to be a great nation. We should support Khan in this fight,” said Banaras. Reema Omer, a lawyer who was victim to a lengthy online trolling campaign by Khan’s supporters, said Khan was creating a wave of public anger that could prove difficult to control. “This narrative is based on no evidence whatsoever and has repeatedly been debunked,” said Omer. “However, Imran Khan is following Goebbels’ playbook, using ‘convenient lies’ that evoke strong emotions and spew hatred and contempt, not caring about how dangerous the effects can be for society.” With Khan expected to contest the next general election, which is likely to be called before the end of the year, many are predicting a volatile time ahead for Pakistan. “I wasn’t dangerous when I was in government,” said Khan on Wednesday, addressing a rally. “But I will be now.”"
US urges Serbia to join sanctions against its ally Russia,"US urges Serbia to join sanctions against its ally Russia A U.S. Senate delegation has urged Serbia to join the rest of Europe and impose sanctions against Russia for its bloody campaign in Ukraine Russian offensive in Ukraine has now begun: Zelenskyy BELGRADE, Serbia -- A U.S. Senate delegation on Tuesday urged Serbia to join the rest of Europe and impose sanctions against Russia for its bloody campaign in Ukraine. “We understand Serbia has a long cultural and economic history with Russia,” said Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) after the three-member bi-partisan delegation met Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic. “But this is a moment where there is great risk if we, as a democratic community, don’t send a united message about the consequences of Russia’s behavior in Ukraine,” he told reporters. “And our hope is that we will be able to stand with Serbia in the coming weeks and months to send that clear message to Russia.” Although Serbia voted in favor of three United Nations resolutions condemning the Russian aggression against Ukraine, it has not joined international sanctions against Moscow. Serbia, which is formally seeking European Union membership, depends almost entirely on Russian energy supplies. Vucic has said that imposing sanctions against traditional Slavic allies in Moscow would be disastrous for Serbia. “I think we made the case that as the president (Vucic) has said, the future of Serbia lies with the rest of Europe, lies in the West, and he has been moving in that direction, (with) trade ties, business investment.” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). “And as we pointed out, if that’s the intent, then certainly looking at the foreign policy that’s currently in place by the EU is very important.” The senators also said that if Serbia really wants to join the EU, it should reconsider on rapidly arming itself with Russian and Chinese weapons. “In in the long run, I think every country needs to make a decision about whether their security interests are best aligned with China,” Murphy said. “If Serbia is intent on being a member of the European Union, then it’s probably not in their long-term interests to have a security relationship with China.” Serbia’s rapid military buildup in the region that was at war in the 1990s has worried its neighbors and raised fears in the West of new possible bloodshed in the Balkans. Earlier this month, China delivered a sophisticated air defense system to Belgrade despite earlier U.S. warnings that if Serbia wants to join Western integrations it should align its military with Western standards."
Israeli settlers march in West Bank amid wave of unrest,"Israeli settlers march in West Bank amid wave of unrest Thousands of Israelis marched to a dismantled settlement deep in the occupied West Bank and called for it to be rebuilt BURQA, West Bank -- Thousands of Israelis marched to a dismantled settlement deep in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday and called for it to be rebuilt in a show of strength amid a wave of Israeli-Palestinian unrest and         fears of further escalation. The army blocked roads to facilitate the march led by hard-line Jewish settlers and prevent Palestinians from reaching the area. Dozens of Palestinian residents protested the closures. Clashes broke out, with Israeli soldiers firing rubber bullets and tear gas at Palestinian youths hurling stones and burning tires. Palestinian medics said they treated at least eight Palestinians who were struck by rubber bullets or tear gas canisters fired by Israeli troops in the adjacent West Bank village of Burqa. Israelis have repeatedly returned to Homesh, a hilltop settlement that emerged as a         symbol of settler defiance after the government dismantled it in 2005. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have surged in recent weeks after a series of deadly attacks inside Israel and and military operations in the West Bank. Palestinian militants         fired a rocket from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel for the first time in months, and Israel carried out airstrikes, after days of clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem. The unrest has raised fears of a repeat of last year, when protests and clashes in Jerusalem helped ignite an 11-day Gaza war. The shrine, known to Muslims as the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and to Jews as the Temple Mount, is the emotional epicenter of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel said its security forces entered the site in response to Palestinian rock-throwing and that it is committed to ensuring that Jews, Christians and Muslims can worship freely in the Holy Land. The Palestinians view the presence of Israeli security forces at Al-Aqsa and         visits by nationalist and religious Jews as a provocation. Israel has faced intense criticism from Jordan, which serves as custodian of the site, as well as Egypt — Arab states that made peace with Israel decades ago. The United Arab Emirates, which led the way in normalizing relations with Israel as part of the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020, summoned the recently appointed Israeli ambassador on Tuesday. The UAE said Israel needs to “fully protect worshippers, to respect the rights of Palestinians to practice their religious rites and to stop any practices that violate the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque,"" according to a statement carried by the state-run WAM news agency. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he discussed the violence in a telephone call with Israel's largely ceremonial President Isaac Herzog. “During this sensitive period, I would like to emphasize, once again, the need not to allow provocations and threats against the status and spirituality of Al-Aqsa Mosque,” Erdogan said. It was an unusually muted statement for Erdogan, who has been an outspoken critic of Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians in the past. Turkey, whose economy is in crisis, has been trying to normalize its frayed ties with Israel and other regional countries. Herzog visited Turkey last month, becoming         the first Israeli leader to visit in 14 years. The U.N. Security Council emerged from a closed-door session Tuesday with no unanimous message on the tensions, though envoys from Ireland, France, Estonia, Norway and Albania stood together to express concern. They called for respecting arrangements at holy sites and for restraint from both sides, while condemning rocket fire from Gaza and “all acts of terrorism.” The United States, Israel's closest ally, has also called on all sides to exercise restraint. At the march in the occupied West Bank, several thousand Israelis, including young children, walked roughly two kilometers (one mile) to Homesh, where organizers staged festivities attended by religious nationalist politicians and rabbis. The Israeli military didn't formally authorize the march but closed roads to separate the settlers and Palestinians, allowing it to be held. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and in the decades since has built dozens of settlements that are now home to more than 500,000 Israelis. The Palestinians seek the territory, which is home to nearly 3 million Palestinians, as the main part of a future independent state. Most of the international community considers the settlements to be illegal. Israel views the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people. The peace process ground to a halt more than a decade ago. The settlement of Homesh was built on private Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank and was dismantled in 2005. In the years since, Israeli settlers have staged several marches, rallies and attempts to rebuild it in violation of Israeli law and military orders. In December, Palestinian militants killed a Jewish settler near the site of the former settlement. A month earlier, six Palestinian farmers were hospitalized after settlers attacked them with metal batons and stones. ——— Ben Zion reported from Jerusalem.

South Africa launches relief for Durban flooding; 448 dead,"South Africa launches relief for Durban flooding; 448 dead Declaring a national state of disaster, South Africa has allocated $67 million to help those hit by floods that have killed at least 448 people in the eastern city of Durban and the surrounding KwaZulu-Natal province Major flooding kills hundreds in South Africa JOHANNESBURG -- Declaring a national state of disaster, South Africa has allocated $67 million to help those hit by floods that have killed at least 448 people in the eastern city of Durban and the surrounding KwaZulu-Natal province. Nearly 4,000 homes have been destroyed and more than 40,000 people displaced by the floods and mudslides caused by prolonged heavy rains, provincial officials said Tuesday. More than 40 people remain missing and about 600 schools have been hit with damages estimated at about $28 million, according to officials. South Africa's military has deployed 10,000 troops in Operation Chariot to help with continuing search and rescue efforts, deliver food, water, and clothing to flood victims, and rebuild collapsed roads and bridges. Water tankers have been sent to areas where access to clean water has been disrupted and teams are working to restore electricity to large areas. Students shoveled mud out of some schools that had been flooded. Visiting some of the flooded areas last week, South African President Cyril Ramophosa blamed climate change for the unprecedented rains, the heaviest in at least 60 years. Announcing the state of disaster in a televised address Monday night, Ramaphosa pledged that government funds for the flood victims will not be lost to corruption. “There can be no room for corruption, mismanagement or fraud of any sort,"" said Ramaphosa. “Learning from the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are drawing together various stakeholders to be part of an oversight structure to ensure all funds disbursed to respond to this disaster are properly accounted for and that the state receives value for money,” he said. Ramaphosa's remarks come after widespread graft was uncovered by the state’s Special Investigating Unit in state funds that were supposed to help the nation respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Former Health Minister Zweli Mkhize resigned after the investigation found that businesses linked to his family benefited from inflated COVID-19 contracts from his department. Despite Ramaphosa's pledge, many South Africans are skeptical that government funds for flood relief will not be diverted by corruption. Several businesses, prominent South Africans and charities have pledged money to private organizations. South African businessman Patrice Motsepe, Ramaphosa's brother-in-law, has made one of the biggest donations pledging about $2 million to Gift of the Givers, a South African-based disaster relief organization. The University of Johannesburg said it will also donate funds directly to Gift of the Givers. South African-born Hollywood actress Charlize Theron has also appealed for funds for flood relief through her Africa Outreach Project. South Africa had been in a national state of disaster over COVID-19 since March 2020 until it was lifted two weeks ago, but it has now been reinstated in response to the Durban floods. ——— This story was corrected to show that more than 40 people are missing and the KwaZulu-Natal is the correct spelling."

Michelle Obama's brother and his wife sue children's former school,"Michelle Obama's brother and his wife sue children's former school Craig and Kelly Robinson allege that the school had systemic racist issues.  Michelle Obama's brother, wife speak out on suit against children's former school A private school in Milwaukee is facing a lawsuit from two of its most famous parents. Craig Robinson, the brother of former first lady Michelle Obama, and his wife, Kelly Robinson, are suing the University School of Milwaukee, alleging it expelled their two young sons after raising concerns about racial and socio-economic bias at the school. The Robinsons, who live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, enrolled their two children -- an 11-year-old and a 9-year-old -- in USM, a pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade school, in 2016. The school expelled their older child in April 2021 and then their younger son in June 2021, which eventually led to the couple suing USM on Monday. The Robinsons spoke to ""Good Morning America"" Tuesday following the legal action. ""We're moving forward with this for a couple of reasons. We want to hold University School of Milwaukee accountable not just to our two children who they retaliated against, but more importantly, there's a whole community of people who are out there that we wouldn't feel right if this happened moving forward,"" Craig Robinson said. ""The third reason is, this needs to stop and change and this will help all students at the University School of Milwaukee."" The school's reasoning for both childrens' dismissal, according to a letter it sent the couple, was because the Robinsons had ""not fulfilled the foregoing commitments as a partner to USM and its Middle School teachers and administrators."" But Craig and Kelly Robinson say in the lawsuit it's because of prior conversations they had with school administrators about racial and ethnic stereotypes in virtual classroom assignments. ""Because our school has not been served with a complaint and not had time to review the allegations, we are not in [a] position to comment on this pending legal matter at this time,"" Steve Hancock, Head of School at University School of Milwaukee said in a statement to ""GMA."" The Robinsons said they started noticing issues in their kids' classroom assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the lawsuit, the couple said they had ""communicated to USM their concerns about USM's failure to provide the 'supportive, inclusive' learning environment that was promised in the enrollment contract, the USM Middle School Handbook, USM's Common Trust."" Furthermore, the couple alleges in the suit that USM ""acted toward its model students of color with none of the respect, trust, honesty, fairness or even the basic kindness, mandated by the Common Trust."" Craig and Kelly Robinson said they also recalled a time when their students were denied the chance to test out of a math class, but only white students were able to take the exam, according to the suit. ""As a lot of parents, we heard what was going on in the classroom because of COVID and there were repeated use of racial and ethnic stereotypes that were in actual assignments,"" Craig Robinson said. ""The use of the word plantation and things of that nature. In addition to the racial and ethnic stereotypes, there was an insensitivity to socioeconomic status and as well as a disregard for the children who weren't physically in the classroom."" He added that their initial response was to ""have a communication with them and give them some suggestions"" but that it was ""summarily dismissed."" During the 2020-2021 school year, the Robinsons raised concerns about USM's treatment of its students of color and underrepresented students. According to the lawsuit, ""the Robinsons communicated directly with USM faculty and staff about the inclusion of language in various worksheets and projects that was offensive to persons of color, persons with disabilities, indigenous Americans and other underrepresented students."" Kelly Robinson also submitted two separate bias incident reports in January and March 2021 that outlined her and her husband's concerns about classwork that contained socioeconomic insensitivities, the couple says in the suit. ""The first bias that we noticed I did put a report in and was told that the reporting system was not working,"" she told ""GMA."" ""The head of school told me that this was not a bias -- Each other time following when any bias was reported, instead of acknowledging and working to make it better, they ended up dismissing our students."" The suit claims that the school took no action to respond to the reports and instead terminated their sons' enrollment at USM, claiming in a letter they wrote to the couple that the Robinsons had ""repeatedly engaged in disrespectful and demanding communications with and about our teachers and administrators."" While the Robinsons have expressed their experience with the school, they say that the issues that they've seen are part of a broader pattern that has extended over many years. In addition to the alleged racial slurs used by white students, that USM was made aware of over the past two years, one school activity, according to the suit, dubbed ""Underground Railroad,"" was also flagged as a concern by the parents. According to the lawsuit, the ""Underground Railroad"" was a simulation in which students of color were told to act like ""runaway slaves"" while USM faculty acted as ""slave catchers."" The program was discontinued only after multiple students of color, USM parents, Black alumni and others protested its insensitivity, the couple said in the suit. ""Just as recently as 10 years ago, the University School of Milwaukee had in their fourth-grade curriculum that students reenacted the underground railroad. And students dressed up as slaves and ran through the school in the dark and the teachers were actually the slave masters who captured these students,"" Kelly Robinson said. She added that ""hearing these stories and understanding the pain that other families have gone through are one of the reasons why we wanted to come forward with this story."" Now, the couple says they hope that their lawsuit will put pressure on the school to create a more inclusive and diverse environment, according to the suit."

Netflix shares drop 25% after service loses 200K subscribers,"Netflix shares drop 25% after service loses 200K subscribers Netflix suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its shares to plunge 25% in extended trading amid concerns that the pioneering streaming service may have already seen its best days Netflix reports loss of 200,000 subscribers SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its shares to plunge 25% in extended trading amid concerns that the pioneering streaming service may have already seen its best days. The company’s customer base fell by 200,000 subscribers during the January-March period, according to its quarterly earnings report released Tuesday. It's the first time that Netflix's subscribers have fallen since the streaming service became available throughout most of the world outside of China six years ago. The drop this year stemmed in part from Netflix's decision to withdraw from Russia to protest the war against Ukraine, resulting in a loss of 700,000 subscribers. Netflix acknowledged its problems are deep rooted by projecting a loss of another 2 million subscribers during the April-June period. If the stock drop extends into Wednesday’s regular trading session, Netflix shares will have lost more than half of their value so far this year — wiping out about $150 billion in shareholder wealth in less than four months. Netflix is hoping to reverse the tide by taking steps it has previously resisted, including blocking the sharing of accounts and introducing a lower-priced — and ad-supported — version of its service. Aptus Capital Advisors analyst David Wagner said it’s now clear that Netflix is grappling with an imposing challenge. “They are in no-(wo) man’s land,” Wagner wrote in a research note Tuesday. Netflix absorbed its biggest blow since losing 800,000 subscribers in 2011 — the result of unveiled plans to begin charging separately for its then-nascent streaming service, which had been bundled for free with its traditional DVD-by-mail service. The customer backlash to that move elicited an apology from Netflix CEO Reed Hastings for botching the execution of the spin-off. The latest subscriber loss was far worse than a forecast by Netflix management for a conservative gain of 2.5 million subscribers. The news deepens troubles that have been mounting for the streaming since a surge of signups from a captive audience during the pandemic began to slow. It marks the fourth time in the last five quarters that Netflix’s subscriber growth has fallen below the gains of the previous year, a malaise that has been magnified by stiffening competition from well-funded rivals such as Apple and Walt Disney. The setback follows the company's addition of 18.2 million subscribers in 2021, its weakest annual growth since 2016. That contrasted with an increase of 36 million subscribers during 2020 when people were corralled at home and starved for entertainment, which Netflix was able to quickly and easily provide with its stockpile of original programming. Netflix has previously predicted that it will regain its momentum, but on Tuesday faced up to the issues bogging it down. “COVID created a lot of noise on how to read the situation,"" Hastings said in a video conference reviewing the latest numbers. Among other things, Hastings confirmed Netflix will start crack down on the sharing of subscriber passwords that has enabled multiple households to access its service from a single account, with changes likely to roll out during the next year or so. The Los Gatos, California, company estimated that about 100 million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member, including 30 million in the U.S. and Canada. “”Those are over 100 million households already are choosing to view Netflix,"" Hastings said. “They love the service. We’ve just got to get paid at some degree for them."" To stop the practice and prod more people to pay for their own accounts, Netflix indicated it will expand         a test introduced last month in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica  that allows subscribers to add up to two people living outside their households to their accounts for an additional fee. Netflix ended March with 221.6 million worldwide subscribers. The subscriber downturn clipped Netflix's finances in the first quarter when the company's profit fell 6% from last year to $1.6 billion, or $3.53 per share. Revenue climbed 10% from last year to nearly $7.9 billion. With the pandemic easing, people have been finding other things to do, and other video streaming services are working hard to lure new viewers with their own award-winning programming. Apple, for instance, held the exclusive streaming rights to “CODA,” which eclipsed Netflix’s “Power of The Dog,” among other movies, to win Best Picture at last month’s Academy Awards. Escalating inflation over the past year has also squeezed household budgets, leading more consumers to rein in their spending on discretionary items. Despite that pressure, Netflix recently raised its prices in the U.S., where it has its greatest household penetration — and where it's had the most trouble finding more subscribers. In the most recent quarter, Netflix lost 640,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, prompting management to point out that most of its future growth will come in international markets. Netflix also is trying to give people another reason to subscribe by adding video games at no extra charge —         a feature that began to roll out last year."
Tennessee governor declines to intervene as execution looms,"Tennessee governor declines to intervene as execution looms Tennessee’s governor says he won't intervene in the state's plans to execute an inmate convicted of killing his estranged wife and her sons decades ago On Location: April 18, 2022 NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee's governor said Tuesday that he will not intervene in the scheduled execution later this week of an inmate convicted of fatally stabbing and shooting his estranged wife and her sons decades ago. Attorneys for 72-year-old Oscar Smith had asked Republican Gov. Bill Lee for clemency, citing problems with the jury in his 1990 trial. Smith is set to receive a lethal injection on Thursday. Lee issued a one-sentence statement declining to step in. “After thorough consideration of Oscar Smith’s request for clemency and an extensive review of the case, the State of Tennessee’s sentence will stand, and I will not be intervening,” Lee wrote.

Pakistan ‘inches away’ from civil unrest after ousting of Imran Khan,"Pakistan ‘inches away’ from civil unrest after ousting of Imran Khan Former PM is accused of creating wave of public anger that could prove difficult to control On Tuesday, two days after Imran Khan had been ousted as Pakistan’s prime minister in a dramatic no-confidence vote, Noor Alam Khan – a politician and former member of Khan’s party – was eating dinner at a restaurant when he was confronted by another diner. The man began shouting “traitor”, “American agent” and “turncoat” and then lunged over to punch Khan, who had been attempting to ignore him. In the middle of the restaurant, the politician and the angry voter began to brawl, with food and tables going flying. For Noor Khan, who was among the dozens of members of Imran Khan’s supporters who recently switched sides and voted against him in the no-confidence vote, the incident was the culmination of mounting abuse he has faced in recent weeks from the former prime minister’s supporters. “I have been harassed and faced death threats since I announced that I would vote against Imran Khan in the no-confidence vote,” he said. “I have received phone calls saying: we will kill you and your children like Benazir Bhutto [former prime minister who was assassinated] because you are an American agent and betrayed prime minister Imran Khan.” Similar chaos ensued on Saturday at a gathering of the Punjab assembly meant to be discussing the election of a new chief minister , as supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and opposition lawmakers began to aggressively confront each other and the deputy speaker, Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari, was attacked by members of the treasury benches. In a tweet after the incident, Khan’s former information minister and close ally Fawad Chaudhry tweeted that Pakistan was “inches away from fully fledged civil unrest”. “Imran Khan has exercised utmost restraint,” he said. “Very soon even he won’t be able to stop this very angry mob and we’ll see the country plunging into a civil unrest.” Khan, Pakistan’s premier cricketer turned pious Islamist prime minister, was elected in 2018 on a wave of populist sentiment, speaking out against the west and Pakistan’s powerful political dynasties, who had been shrouded in corruption allegations. But while his charisma and populist rhetoric never failed to pull in the crowds at rallies, he also oversaw a period of huge financial turmoil and massive inflation that devastated the economy. After losing the support of the powerful military, the opposition moved in with a no-confidence vote, backed by many from Khan’s own coalition who had lost faith in the prime minister. Shehbaz Sharif, the leader of the opposition coalition and brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was elected by the national assembly to succeed him. But the removal of Khan has in no way led to the demise of the populist politics he fostered while in office. Many fear that the deep polarisation cultivated by Khan could prove deeply destabilising for Pakistan, pushing the country into greater political turmoil that the new prime minister, who is known more for his skills as an administrator than a charismatic leader, might be unable to contain. In recent days, the inflammatory rallying cry of Khan, who has gone back out on the campaign trail with gusto, has been “ghaddari” – traitors – with anyone opposing him, be it his political parties, the media, activists, intellectuals and the judiciary being tarnished as part of a “foreign conspiracy” to oust him. Pervez Hoodbhoy, an analyst who has extensively written on Khan, called the former prime minister “a true populist”. “Khan has polarised Pakistan to such an extreme level,” said Hoodbhoy. “The coming days will be chaotic as his insatiable lust for power makes him truly dangerous for this country.” Evoking popular anti-western sentiment that he has played on for the past four years in office, Khan has continued to push the narrative that the no-confidence vote which ousted him was a “foreign conspiracy” by the west, citing diplomatic correspondence with the US to prove it. The US vehemently denied it and no definitive proof of a conspiracy has been shown. In a rare press conference on Thursday, Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, the spokesperson of the armed forces, dismantled Khan’s narrative and rejected the claim that a diplomatic cable contained evidence of foreign interference. Iftikhar, referring to the diplomatic communication, said: “Is there any word such as conspiracy used in it? I think not.” He also clarified that the US never asked for army bases in Pakistan, something Imran khan used as “evidence” of why the US wanted him to be ousted. Yet the stance of the military establishment, which wields huge power in the country, has also made its members targets of a social media campaign led by Khan’s supporters, who see the army as having played a role in the prime minister’s fall from power. Tens of thousands of tweets have been sent in recent days criticising the army. On Wednesday, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested 12 social media activists who reportedly ran these campaigns, which Iftikhar called “illegal, immoral and against national interest”. On the streets of cities and towns across Pakistan, the narrative that Khan was victim to a western conspiracy has been powerful and pervasive, and thousands have continued to come out in protest in support of him. Addressing a huge crowd on Wednesday, Khan said that a decisive moment had arrived, and the nation needed to choose if it wanted “slavery or liberty” from the US. Khan accused the opposition leaders of being an “imported government” who are “slaves of the US” and said he and his supporters would be on the streets until fresh elections were announced. Muhammad Banaras, 35, a resident in Islamabad, said Khan was the first prime minister to “think about the poor and challenge the corrupt”. “Khan has talked about Islam, the rights of Kashmiris and against corruption. The west and the US are against him, they don’t want Pakistan to be a great nation. We should support Khan in this fight,” said Banaras. Reema Omer, a lawyer who was victim to a lengthy online trolling campaign by Khan’s supporters, said Khan was creating a wave of public anger that could prove difficult to control. “This narrative is based on no evidence whatsoever and has repeatedly been debunked,” said Omer. “However, Imran Khan is following Goebbels’ playbook, using ‘convenient lies’ that evoke strong emotions and spew hatred and contempt, not caring about how dangerous the effects can be for society.” With Khan expected to contest the next general election, which is likely to be called before the end of the year, many are predicting a volatile time ahead for Pakistan. “I wasn’t dangerous when I was in government,” said Khan on Wednesday, addressing a rally. “But I will be now.”"
‘Lawless logging’ in DRC raises concerns over $500m forests deal signed by Boris Johnson,"‘Lawless logging’ in DRC raises concerns over $500m forests deal signed by Boris Johnson Critics say cash from UK, Norway, France and Germany could be wasted as damning report reveals illegalities, corruption and environmental crimes  Environmental groups have raised concerns about a $500m (£380m) forest protection deal signed by Boris Johnson at Cop26, after a damning report into the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s “lawless” logging sector. Johnson signed the letter of intent on behalf of the Central African Forest Initiative (Cafi) for a 10-year agreement which includes objectives to protect high-value forests and peatlands. Of the £200m committed to protecting the Congo basin by the UK at Cop26, £32m was given to Cafi from the aid budget. At the beginning of April, the DRC government released a long-awaited audit of the country’s logging industry. It found that six successive ministers had illegally allocated at least 18 logging concessions, breaking a near 20-year moratorium on new industrial felling in the world’s second largest rainforest. More than $3m in royalties has not been paid to the government by operators due to a “chaotic situation”, according to the audit, which marks the first step of the deal between the DRC and 12 donors signed on the first day of Cop26 in Glasgow to unlock $500m to protect the vast ecosystem. Environmental groups have said taxpayer money from the UK, Norway, France and Germany could go to waste if no action is taken on the illegal concessions, with the moratorium on industrial logging due to be lifted at the end of this year. The DRC environment ministry issued a review of all forest concession contracts after the audit but environmental groups are demanding suspensions and prosecutions of violations. Known as the lungs of Africa, the Congo basin rainforest is home to endangered forest elephants and gorillas and is an enormous carbon store that sustains rainfall as far away as Egypt and is home to about 80 million people. It absorbs about 4% of the world’s annual carbon emissions. Irene Wabiwa Betoko, Congo basin forest lead for Greenpeace, said: “The audit reveals a circus of illegalities, corruption and crimes against the environment. Greenpeace Africa demands a legal investigation of all officials responsible for plundering the rainforest, and, where necessary, the lifting of their parliamentary immunity.” Despite the ban on new industrial logging, the DRC has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing 490,000 hectares (1.2m acres) of primary rainforest in 2020, according to Global Forest Watch. Lord Goldsmith, minister for the international environment, visited the region last month after the DRC failed to meet the first step of the Cop26 agreement and publish the audit at the start of January. In a statement, he said his trip was a great opportunity to speak to leaders in one of the most important and biodiversity rich areas of Earth. “The leadership of Congo basin countries at Cop26 was hugely impactful, where big promises were made both by donor countries and Congo basin countries. I am determined that those promises are kept,” he said. Cafi, the coalition of donor countries that made the $500m deal with the DRC, welcomed the release of the audit but said no money had been released yet. In a statement to the Guardian, it commended the publication of the report by the DRC Inspection générale des finances on logging concessions and said it would continue to work in collaboration with the DRC government on strengthening forest governance. “Cafi remains committed to supporting the DRC to help ensure that the objectives and commitments outlined in the 2021-2031 letter of intent are met,” it said.

Russia takes Donbas town but Ukrainian frontline ‘still holding’,"Russia takes Donbas town but Ukrainian frontline ‘still holding’ Ukrainian troops forced to withdraw from small city of Kreminna after ferocious assault as Russia moves towards Kramatorsk Russia’s large-scale offensive to seize the Donbas region was under way on Tuesday when troops overran the city of Kreminna in eastern Ukraine and began advancing towards the strategic Ukrainian military hub of Kramatorsk. The regional governor said Ukrainian soldiers had abandoned Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people, after it came under ferocious Russian attack. The assault took place “from all sides”, he said. It is the first victory for Moscow since its battle for the Donbas began on Monday. “Kreminna is under the control of the ‘Orcs’ [Russians]. They have entered the city,” Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, told a briefing. “Our defenders had to withdraw. They have entrenched themselves in new positions and continue to fight the Russian army.” Haidai said it was “impossible” to know how many civilians had been killed: “We have official statistics – about 200 dead – but in reality there are many more.” He said that “street fighting” was taking place, with four people shot by Russians as they tried to escape by car. The city had already been pulverised by extensive Russian shelling. It is located close to territory held by pro-Moscow separatists. Russian forces are now creeping towards the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, 40 miles (60km) south-east. Meanwhile in the south, Moscow is edging closer to full control of Mariupol in what would be its biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February. Relentless bombardment and street fighting have left much of the city pulverised, killing at least 21,000 people by Ukrainian estimates. On Tuesday evening, according to reports that could not be independently verified by the Guardian, the Russian defence ministry offered a ceasefire for Wednesday to the outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian soldiers holed up with thousands of civilians in the Azovstal iron and steelworks, one of Europe’s biggest metallurgical plants.  Earlier in the day, Russia called on Ukrainian forces to “immediately lay down arms” by issuing a new ultimatum for the defenders to end their resistance, after Ukrainian forces ignored a previous ultimatum on Sunday. In a video address late on Monday night, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the second phase of Vladimir Putin’s invasion had begun – a statement Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, confirmed during a visit to India. “A significant part of the entire Russian army is now concentrated on this offensive,” Zelenskiy said. Late last month the Kremlin gave up its violent attempt to seize Kyiv. It says its new war goal is to conquer the administrative borders of Luhansk and Donetsk regions. To do so will involve overcoming Ukraine’s experienced and well dug-in eastern army. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Zelenskiy aide, predicted the new Russian offensive would fail because of insufficient forces to achieve a breakthrough.  Another senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said a hubristic Kremlin was making the same mistake as with Kyiv, which it reportedly expected to capture in 72 hours. “Russians love to tell fairytales,” he tweeted sarcastically. So far, according to Ukrainian officials, the frontline in Ukrainian-controlled Donbas is still holding. Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov described Kreminna in the northern Luhansk region as a “weak spot”. Moscow’s troops frequently attack Ukrainian positions from all sides, said Zhdanov, and were occupying jumping-off points on three sides of the Donbas region: north, east and south. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said Russian forces may be able to take some territory because of superior numbers and artillery. It stressed, however: “Russian operations are unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv. The Russian military is unlikely to have addressed the root causes – poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations, and low morale – that impeded prior offensives.” In the northern Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces mounted several successful counterattacks. They recaptured the villages of Bairak and Bobrivka north-east of Kharkiv city, and Hurisivka, another village between Kharkiv and Izyum, where Russia has assembled a formidable attack force. On Monday, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s ministry of defence, said Izyum was the area with the highest concentration of Russian troops. Izyum, regarded for centuries as the gateway to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine and, from there, to the Black Sea, fell fully to Russian forces on 1 April, trapping thousands of civilians in a city where as many as 80% of its residential buildings have been destroyed. “The enemy has accumulated its forces in Izyum and, unfortunately, has a predominant number of manpower and heavy equipment,” Maksym Strelnyk, the deputy mayor, who managed to leave with thousands of fellow citizens before the town was captured, told the Guardian. “The Russians are trying to move in the direction of Donetsk region, but there are no serious successes. They are using Izyum as a foothold for the offensive and concentrating all their forces in the city. They set up their barracks, ammunition depots, hospitals, canteens.” The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol alleged that about 40,000 civilians had been forcibly moved to Russia or Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine. “Unfortunately I have to declare that as of today they are forcibly deporting [people],” Vadym Boichenko told Ukrainian TV. “We have verified through the municipal register that they have already deported over 40,000 people.” The fall of Mariupol, the largest trading port in the Sea of Azov, from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery, would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia. The town is a base for Ukrainian armed forces, and serves as a land corridor from the Donbas to Crimea. If Moscow were to capture Mariupol, it would be the first big city to fall and mark perhaps Russia’s biggest gain of the nearly two-month war."
US and Cuban officials to hold talks amid tensions over migration,"US and Cuban officials to hold talks amid tensions over migration Cuba says US sanctions and decision to close American consular section in Havana encourage Cubans to seek riskier routes to US American and Cuban officials are due to meet in Washington on Thursday to discuss migration concerns, people familiar with the matter said, in the highest-level formal US talks with Havana since Joe Biden took office last year. The meeting comes at a time when Biden’s administration is grappling with rising numbers of undocumented migrants attempting to cross the US border from Mexico, with Cubans making up a growing portion of them. Tensions between Washington and Havana over the Cuban government’s crackdown on protests, continuing American sanctions on the communist-ruled island and other issues have made it difficult for the countries to cooperate on challenges such as irregular migration. Leading the Cuban delegation will be the deputy foreign minister, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The delegation is expected to meet with senior officials of the US state department and other agencies. The US wants Cuba to take back more deportees from among the record numbers of Cubans arriving at the US-Mexico border, according to a US official and another source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Cuba has said it supports legal, orderly and safe migration. It blames the US for the uptick in irregular migration, saying cold war-era sanctions and a decision to close the American consular section in Havana encourage Cubans to seek riskier routes to leave the island. The state department last month said it would again begin processing some visas for Cubans in Havana to start reducing the backlog after a four-year hiatus, but progress has been slow. “We have seen a significant increase in irregular Cuban migrants to the United States, both via land and maritime routes,” a state department spokesperson said. “Cubans currently rank the second-largest group arriving to the United States’ south-west border.” The spokesperson, who asked not to be named, declined to confirm the planned meeting but said “we regularly engage with Cuban officials on issues of importance to the US government, such as human rights and migration”. Thursday’s planned talks appear to be at a higher level than known formal contacts since Biden took office in January 2021. The Cuban government did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment. The talks are scheduled to be held just a day after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and regional counterparts are due to wrap up a conference on migration in Panama. Cuba is not due to attend that conference. A record number of migrants attempted to cross the US-Mexican border during Biden’s first year in office. American officials are preparing for even higher numbers this year. Amid Cuba’s faltering economy, after Nicaragua lifted visa requirements for Cubans in November, many dropped everything, sold their homes and took a flight for Managua, with hopes of heading north through Central America to the US. Nicaragua, a close regional ally of Cuba, said the move was intended to promote commercial exchange, tourism and humanitarian family relations. Initial fervor has been followed by frustration as the US has undertaken a regional effort to curb border crossings. The number of Cubans apprehended at the US-Mexico border reached 16,531 in February, the highest single-month total on record, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. Even as Washington and Havana prepare to re-engage on migration, Biden administration officials are mindful that any easing of restrictions on Cuba could lead to political fallout from conservative Cuban Americans, a key voting bloc in south Florida. Donald Trump rolled back a historic rapprochement that his predecessor Barack Obama oversaw between the US and its old cold war foe."
Scott Morrison fends off claim Solomon Islands-China pact is worst foreign policy failure since 1945,"Scott Morrison fends off claim Solomon Islands-China pact is worst foreign policy failure since 1945 Prime minister defends Canberra’s ‘calibrated’ approach to Honiara and tries to turn criticism back on Labor The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has fended off accusations that he is responsible for “the worst Australian foreign policy failure” in the Pacific since the end of the second world war after the Solomon Islands struck a new security pact with China. Labor has seized on the new agreement as evidence that Australia has been asleep at the wheel while China has cemented its influence in the region, with leader Anthony Albanese saying more should have been done to prevent it from going ahead. The Coalition last week dispatched the minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja, to Honiara, where he “respectfully” asked the Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, to consider not signing the proposed security agreement with China.  But his appeal fell on deaf ears, with Sogavare confirming to the country’s parliament on Wednesday that the pact had been signed, but saying he did not believe it would affect the “peace and harmony of our region”. Morrison defended sending Seselja instead of the foreign minister, Marise Payne, who Sky News reported was hosting a fundraiser in Sydney at the time. “The judgement was made not to engage at a foreign-minister level engagement to ensure that Australia’s views were communicated very clearly and very respectfully,” Morrison said. “I’m very conscious of how visits are perceived within the Pacific. This was the right, calibrated way to address this issue with the prime minister. “One of the things you don’t do in the Pacific is you don’t throw your weight around. They’re a sovereign country and we have to respect their sovereignty.” But Albanese said Australia’s relationship with the Solomon Islands was of crucial strategic importance and criticised the government for failing to act after being warned last August that the deal was imminent. “No visit from the foreign minister, no visit from the defence minister, no engagement in a serious way with prime minister Sogavare,” Albanese said. “Whether it’s the bushfires, whether it’s ordering enough vaccines, whether it’s ordering rapid antigen tests, whether it’s responding to the floods, this prime minister is complacent. He’s always there for the photo-op, never there for the follow-up, never does the right planning to get ahead of issues.” The Solomon Islands opposition leader, Matthew Wale, told the ABC last month that he had warned Australian officials in August last year about the potential deal and was disappointed in the response. Wale is now calling for Sogavare to make public the text of the agreement, which the US has criticised as a “shadowy deal” that had been struck with little regional consultation. Under sustained questioning about the government’s approach to the Solomon Islands deal on Wednesday, Morrison said the move by China was not a surprise to the government. “What it highlights is there is always incredible pressure on Pacific nations that comes from China seeking to undermine the security of the region ... so we have focused very much on the Pacific because we know the risks, and I think what we have seen there highlights those risks,” the prime minister said. “We can’t always prevent them in all circumstances, [and] the sort of pressure and influence that has been seeking to be exerted in our region is very real. “That’s why for many, many years now we have been seeking to resist this, and had we not done that then I fear that we would have seen even more significant events take place.” At a later press conference, Morrison also sought to turn criticism back to Labor, saying the opposition had been “very passive” when it came to the risk presented by China and our region.

While Sogavare has explicitly ruled that out, this has done little to ease the fears of security officials in Canberra and in Washington. On Monday, the White House said a high-level US delegation, including Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell, would travel to Honiara this week to discuss concerns about China, as well as the reopening of a US embassy. In a statement on Wednesday, the US embassy in Canberra said that it was concerned that the agreement could undermine a “free and open” Indo Pacific. “In particular, we have concerns over the agreement’s lack of transparency, as well as its apparently vague and expansive provisions.” Visiting Singapore, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Adern, said that while the Solomon Islands was free to make its own sovereign decisions, it had previously agreed through the Pacific Island forum to discuss defence matters before making such decisions. “We have continued to reiterate with the Solomons and China our view alongside the Pacific: that collectively we are ready and available to meet the security needs of our neighbours,” Ardern said. “We are concerned about the militarisation of the Pacific and we continue to call on the Solomons to work with the Pacific with any concerns around their security they may have.” But Sogavare told Parliament that the deal would allow it to “build up and strengthen our police capability” to deal with any future instability. “The Solomon Islands-People’s Republic of China security cooperation is based on mutual respect for sovereignty and in compliance with domestic and international law,” he said. “Let me assure the people of Solomon Islands that we entered into an arrangement with China with our eyes wide open, guided by our national interests.”"
US seeks to seize superyacht in Fiji believed to be owned by Russian oligarch,"US seeks to seize superyacht in Fiji believed to be owned by Russian oligarch The Amadea is widely believed to be owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is under US and EU sanctions The United States is seeking to seize a superyacht suspected of belonging to a Russian oligarch that is docked in the Pacific island nation of Fiji, a restraining order filed on Tuesday by Fiji’s director of public prosecutions showed. The luxury vessel the Amadea is widely believed to be owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is the subject of economic sanctions by the United States and European Union imposed in response to Russia’s activities in Syria and Ukraine. The vessel arrived in Fiji a week ago after leaving Mexico 18 days earlier and crossing the Pacific.  Authorities in various countries have seized luxury vessels and villas owned by Russian billionaires in response to sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a special military operation. Fiji’s director of public prosecutions, Christopher Pryde, filed an application to the High Court seeking to prevent the Amadea from leaving Fiji. The application requested “the motor yacht Amadea be restrained from leaving Fijian waters until the finalisation of an application to register a warrant to seize the property and (ii) that a US warrant to seize the Amadea be registered”. The US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but last week said “the United States is committed to finding and seizing the assets of the oligarchs who have supported the Russian Federation’s brutal, unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine“. The court has not heard the application. A superyacht agent in Fiji acting for the Amadea told Reuters last week the vessel’s lawyers were contesting that Suleiman was the owner. Registration records viewed by Reuters show the yacht is registered to a company in the Cayman islands. Kerimov was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 and 2014 in response to Russia’s actions in Syria and Ukraine."
Telstra buyout of Digicel’s Pacific mobile networks threatened by ‘discriminatory’ new PNG tax,"Telstra buyout of Digicel’s Pacific mobile networks threatened by ‘discriminatory’ new PNG tax The $100m tax on companies controlling more than 40% of market is ‘arbitrary’ and ‘perplexing’, says telco Digicel Digicel Group says it is considering legal options after Papua New Guinea imposed a $100m tax that the telecoms firm said had potential “implications” for the planned AU$2.1bn ($1.57bn) sale of the Pacific’s biggest mobile network to Australia’s Telstra. Telstra Corp Ltd said last October that it would buy the Pacific operations of Digicel in a deal largely funded by the Australian government, seen by observers as a way to block China’s rising influence in the region. The operations include 2.5m mobile phone subscribers across PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa and Nauru. Digicel’s Irish founder, Denis O’Brien, met with the PNG prime minister, James Marape, last week to try to resolve the matter, Digicel said in a statement on Monday. It said a “new, arbitrary, company-specific tax” was introduced on 25 March which was “perplexing not just for Digicel but also for the Papua New Guinea economy given the reputational and credit rating implications of this sudden, bizarre and unprecedented tax”. The act imposed a one-time tax liability on Digicel equal to about $100m with a further penalty of $14m for non-payment, the statement said. “This matter requires urgent resolution given its implications for the sale of Digicel’s Pacific operations to Telstra but also given the knock-on consequences for all foreign direct investment exiting Papua New Guinea,” the statement said. “Digicel is now engaged in discussions with the Papua New Guinea government and other relevant stakeholders.”  Marape’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Telstra spokesman said in a statement that the PNG tax was a matter for the current owner of Digicel Pacific. In response to Reuters’ questions, it said it was still awaiting PNG regulatory approvals for the deal. “The acquisition of Digicel Pacific by Telstra in partnership with the Australian government has not yet received all of its regulatory approvals and has not [been] completed yet,” Telstra said. The tax was first flagged last November, when PNG outlined its 2022 budget measures. Parliament was told Digicel holds 90% of the retail mobile voice and internet market. The tax applies only to companies that control more than 40% of PNG’s market for telecommunications and banking. Bank of South Pacific, the only other company affected, told the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday the tax came into effect on 25 March and must be paid annually in September."
Six killed in bomb blasts at Shia school in Afghan capital,"Six killed in bomb blasts at Shia school in Afghan capital Two explosions rock boys' school in Kabul as students were coming out of their morning classes At least six people have been killed and 11 wounded in two bomb blasts at a boys’ school in a Hazara Shia neighbourhood of the Afghan capital, Kabul. The frequency of bomb blasts in the country has declined significantly since the Taliban ousted the US-backed Afghan government in August last year, but Islamic State has claimed several attacks. A Kabul police spokesperson, Khalid Zadran, said Tuesday’s blasts at the Abdul Rahim Shahid school were caused by improvised explosive devices. He said there was a third blast at an English-language centre in the same area, but did not specify whether it was caused by an explosive. The school is in an area inhabited mainly by the Hazara community, and has been previously targeted by IS. Tuesday’s blasts occurred as students were coming out of their morning classes, a witness said. Images posted on social media networks showed several bodies lying at the gate and inside the school compound. Taliban officials were seen cordoning off the area. The Taliban have been blamed previously for attacks targeting Hazaras, who make up 10-20% of the country’s 38 million population. The Taliban insist their forces have defeated IS, but analysts say the jihadist group is a key security challenge to the hardline Islamists who rule Afghanistan. Since seizing power, the Taliban have regularly carried out raids on suspected IS hideouts, mainly in the eastern Nangarhar province. IS has claimed some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan in recent years. In May last year at least 85 people – mainly female students – were killed and about 300 were wounded when three bombs exploded near their school in Dasht-e-Barchi. No group claimed responsibility, but in October 2020 IS claimed a suicide attack on an educational centre in the same area that killed 24 people, including students. In May 2020, the group was blamed for an attack on a maternity ward of a hospital in the neighbourhood that killed 25 people."
Israeli city’s Jewish residents form armed ‘self-defence’ group,"Israeli city’s Jewish residents form armed ‘self-defence’ group Formation of citizens’ militia in Lod in central Israel follows spate of Palestinian attacks across country Jewish residents in a central Israeli city have formed an armed group they say is for self-defence, after a string of Palestinian attacks across the country sparked fears of a new wave of internal violence. The mixed city of Lod, near Tel Aviv, became the focal point of communal bloodshed that flared in Israel last year, with the government and police struggling to control clashes between Arabs and Jews. “Until now, I haven’t personally seen the need to carry a weapon but there are friends who have weapons, certainly. There is weaponry, doctors and medics,” said Michael Lichtenstein, who terms himself the “security coordinator” of the group. More than 50 volunteers serve in the group, based in Ramat Elyashiv, a Jewish area of the city that is a stronghold of rightwing religious nationalists. Lod residents say they have yet to see the group on the streets. But according to its organiser, volunteers are already active in deterring alleged harassment of Jewish children by Arab youths, albeit without the use of guns. Arab residents of the city see the new group as a militia that could target them, accusing the mayor of Lod, Yair Revivo, of backing its establishment. To some on the Israeli far right, the potentially volatile development should be welcomed as boosting the police. “The obligation and right of a citizen to defend himself takes priority and I have a problem with anyone who thinks these people are criminals,” said the Knesset member Simcha Rothman, of the Religious Zionism opposition party, who has moved to Lod temporarily from his settlement in the occupied West Bank to, in his words, bolster a Jewish community threatened by Arabs. Last month, after the bloodiest attack in greater Tel Aviv in years, Israel’s hard-right prime minister called on citizens with gun licences to arm themselves. “What is expected of you, Israeli citizens? Vigilance and responsibility,” Naftali Bennett said in a video statement. “Whoever has a gun licence, this is the time to carry it.” There has been a dramatic rise in applications for gun licences in Israel, according to the local Channel 12 television news. In the wake of the attacks, Israeli troops have responded with deadly raids across the West Bank that are causing the deaths of civilians as well as militants and, critics say, adding fuel to the fire. Lod, notorious for crime and gun violence among a minority of its Arab residents, offers a microcosm of how Arab-Jewish tensions are again rising across Israel, and not only in the occupied Palestinian territories. As Rothman’s relocation shows, the conflict in the West Bank is being imported into Israel proper by the same hardcore religious Jewish nationalists who are fuelling tensions in the area Israel captured in 1967. For Lichtenstein and hardline nationalists, Israel’s future is at stake. “It worries me that [Arabs] aren’t afraid of the police, that the police don’t collect their weapons and that the army has lost its deterrence,” he said. Chen Masika, a history teacher who supports Lichtenstein’s efforts, said the two sides had entered a battle in which the very existence of Jews in Lod and throughout Israel was at stake. “They want everything, not just Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. Leaders of Lod’s Arabs, as well as leftwing Jewish Israeli observers, say the formation of militias can only help push the city to a fresh explosion of violence. “How can we live together if their goal is to deter us from Jews and to frighten us?” asked Fada Shehada, an Arab city councillor. Last year, the city’s streets resembled a war zone, with Arabs and Jews attacked, Muslim graves vandalised and synagogues torched. Lod’s Arab community are the descendants of Palestinians who stayed in the country after the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, when an estimated 700,000 others were expelled or fled. While life was once relatively calm in Lod, known as Lydda in Arabic, today both Arab and Jewish residents say the Israeli police do not do enough to protect them. Lichtenstein, who served for more than 10 years in the Israeli army, some of that as a logistics officer, said his new force would use weapons only in accordance with the law. Its backers say the group is in regular contact with the police. Mayor Revivo’s office and that of the internal security minister, Omer Bar-Lev, did not respond to queries for this article. The armed force was being primed to protect Jewish residents precisely because there could be a fresh oubreak of violence, Lichtenstein said. “I know that if events break out all at once the police won’t reach me in the first hours so my preparedness is for the first hours until the police come. The issue is what do I do to safeguard my neighbourhood and the families that live there?” The Lod security volunteer group had distinct vests and hats, Lichtenstein said. A resident coming out of a mosque who said he was a close relative of Musa Hassouna, an Arab Lod resident who was shot dead last year, said he expected further violence and, pointing towards a nearby Jewish neighbourhood, added: “Because of the settlers”. A Jewish Israeli, Yigal Yehoshua, was also killed in the May violence as a result of stone throwing at his car. Lod’s Jewish residents recall an overwhelmed police force last year failing to respond to their calls for help. They say police have since improved but fear they are still not up to the challenge. Meirav Cohen, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in a mixed building, welcomed Jewish residents organising themselves for self-defence. “There is no choice. We don’t want to be where we were a year ago,” she said.  Eran Nissan, the head of the leftwing Israeli group Mehazkim, said the formation of militias in Lod reflected the fact that Israel was at a very dangerous juncture, especially in light of the current escalation. “When you arm a society, it’s very hard to disarm it,” he said."
US seeks to seize superyacht in Fiji believed to be owned by Russian oligarch,"US seeks to seize superyacht in Fiji believed to be owned by Russian oligarch The Amadea is widely believed to be owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is under US and EU sanctions The United States is seeking to seize a superyacht suspected of belonging to a Russian oligarch that is docked in the Pacific island nation of Fiji, a restraining order filed on Tuesday by Fiji’s director of public prosecutions showed. The luxury vessel the Amadea is widely believed to be owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, who is the subject of economic sanctions by the United States and European Union imposed in response to Russia’s activities in Syria and Ukraine. The vessel arrived in Fiji a week ago after leaving Mexico 18 days earlier and crossing the Pacific.  Authorities in various countries have seized luxury vessels and villas owned by Russian billionaires in response to sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a special military operation. Fiji’s director of public prosecutions, Christopher Pryde, filed an application to the High Court seeking to prevent the Amadea from leaving Fiji. The application requested “the motor yacht Amadea be restrained from leaving Fijian waters until the finalisation of an application to register a warrant to seize the property and (ii) that a US warrant to seize the Amadea be registered”. The US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but last week said “the United States is committed to finding and seizing the assets of the oligarchs who have supported the Russian Federation’s brutal, unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine“. The court has not heard the application. A superyacht agent in Fiji acting for the Amadea told Reuters last week the vessel’s lawyers were contesting that Suleiman was the owner. Registration records viewed by Reuters show the yacht is registered to a company in the Cayman islands. Kerimov was sanctioned by the United States in 2018 and 2014 in response to Russia’s actions in Syria and Ukraine."
Telstra buyout of Digicel’s Pacific mobile networks threatened by ‘discriminatory’ new PNG tax,"Telstra buyout of Digicel’s Pacific mobile networks threatened by ‘discriminatory’ new PNG tax The $100m tax on companies controlling more than 40% of market is ‘arbitrary’ and ‘perplexing’, says telco Digicel Digicel Group says it is considering legal options after Papua New Guinea imposed a $100m tax that the telecoms firm said had potential “implications” for the planned AU$2.1bn ($1.57bn) sale of the Pacific’s biggest mobile network to Australia’s Telstra. Telstra Corp Ltd said last October that it would buy the Pacific operations of Digicel in a deal largely funded by the Australian government, seen by observers as a way to block China’s rising influence in the region. The operations include 2.5m mobile phone subscribers across PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa and Nauru. Digicel’s Irish founder, Denis O’Brien, met with the PNG prime minister, James Marape, last week to try to resolve the matter, Digicel said in a statement on Monday. It said a “new, arbitrary, company-specific tax” was introduced on 25 March which was “perplexing not just for Digicel but also for the Papua New Guinea economy given the reputational and credit rating implications of this sudden, bizarre and unprecedented tax”. The act imposed a one-time tax liability on Digicel equal to about $100m with a further penalty of $14m for non-payment, the statement said. “This matter requires urgent resolution given its implications for the sale of Digicel’s Pacific operations to Telstra but also given the knock-on consequences for all foreign direct investment exiting Papua New Guinea,” the statement said. “Digicel is now engaged in discussions with the Papua New Guinea government and other relevant stakeholders.”  Marape’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Telstra spokesman said in a statement that the PNG tax was a matter for the current owner of Digicel Pacific. In response to Reuters’ questions, it said it was still awaiting PNG regulatory approvals for the deal. “The acquisition of Digicel Pacific by Telstra in partnership with the Australian government has not yet received all of its regulatory approvals and has not [been] completed yet,” Telstra said. The tax was first flagged last November, when PNG outlined its 2022 budget measures. Parliament was told Digicel holds 90% of the retail mobile voice and internet market. The tax applies only to companies that control more than 40% of PNG’s market for telecommunications and banking. Bank of South Pacific, the only other company affected, told the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday the tax came into effect on 25 March and must be paid annually in September."
Six killed in bomb blasts at Shia school in Afghan capital,"Six killed in bomb blasts at Shia school in Afghan capital Two explosions rock boys' school in Kabul as students were coming out of their morning classes At least six people have been killed and 11 wounded in two bomb blasts at a boys’ school in a Hazara Shia neighbourhood of the Afghan capital, Kabul. The frequency of bomb blasts in the country has declined significantly since the Taliban ousted the US-backed Afghan government in August last year, but Islamic State has claimed several attacks. A Kabul police spokesperson, Khalid Zadran, said Tuesday’s blasts at the Abdul Rahim Shahid school were caused by improvised explosive devices. He said there was a third blast at an English-language centre in the same area, but did not specify whether it was caused by an explosive. The school is in an area inhabited mainly by the Hazara community, and has been previously targeted by IS. Tuesday’s blasts occurred as students were coming out of their morning classes, a witness said. Images posted on social media networks showed several bodies lying at the gate and inside the school compound. Taliban officials were seen cordoning off the area. The Taliban have been blamed previously for attacks targeting Hazaras, who make up 10-20% of the country’s 38 million population. The Taliban insist their forces have defeated IS, but analysts say the jihadist group is a key security challenge to the hardline Islamists who rule Afghanistan. Since seizing power, the Taliban have regularly carried out raids on suspected IS hideouts, mainly in the eastern Nangarhar province. IS has claimed some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan in recent years. In May last year at least 85 people – mainly female students – were killed and about 300 were wounded when three bombs exploded near their school in Dasht-e-Barchi. No group claimed responsibility, but in October 2020 IS claimed a suicide attack on an educational centre in the same area that killed 24 people, including students. In May 2020, the group was blamed for an attack on a maternity ward of a hospital in the neighbourhood that killed 25 people."
Israeli city’s Jewish residents form armed ‘self-defence’ group,"Israeli city’s Jewish residents form armed ‘self-defence’ group Formation of citizens’ militia in Lod in central Israel follows spate of Palestinian attacks across country Jewish residents in a central Israeli city have formed an armed group they say is for self-defence, after a string of Palestinian attacks across the country sparked fears of a new wave of internal violence. The mixed city of Lod, near Tel Aviv, became the focal point of communal bloodshed that flared in Israel last year, with the government and police struggling to control clashes between Arabs and Jews. “Until now, I haven’t personally seen the need to carry a weapon but there are friends who have weapons, certainly. There is weaponry, doctors and medics,” said Michael Lichtenstein, who terms himself the “security coordinator” of the group. More than 50 volunteers serve in the group, based in Ramat Elyashiv, a Jewish area of the city that is a stronghold of rightwing religious nationalists. Lod residents say they have yet to see the group on the streets. But according to its organiser, volunteers are already active in deterring alleged harassment of Jewish children by Arab youths, albeit without the use of guns. Arab residents of the city see the new group as a militia that could target them, accusing the mayor of Lod, Yair Revivo, of backing its establishment. To some on the Israeli far right, the potentially volatile development should be welcomed as boosting the police. “The obligation and right of a citizen to defend himself takes priority and I have a problem with anyone who thinks these people are criminals,” said the Knesset member Simcha Rothman, of the Religious Zionism opposition party, who has moved to Lod temporarily from his settlement in the occupied West Bank to, in his words, bolster a Jewish community threatened by Arabs. Last month, after the bloodiest attack in greater Tel Aviv in years, Israel’s hard-right prime minister called on citizens with gun licences to arm themselves. “What is expected of you, Israeli citizens? Vigilance and responsibility,” Naftali Bennett said in a video statement. “Whoever has a gun licence, this is the time to carry it.” There has been a dramatic rise in applications for gun licences in Israel, according to the local Channel 12 television news. In the wake of the attacks, Israeli troops have responded with deadly raids across the West Bank that are causing the deaths of civilians as well as militants and, critics say, adding fuel to the fire. Lod, notorious for crime and gun violence among a minority of its Arab residents, offers a microcosm of how Arab-Jewish tensions are again rising across Israel, and not only in the occupied Palestinian territories.

NSW and Victoria to scrap Covid isolation requirements for household and close contacts,"NSW and Victoria to scrap Covid isolation requirements for household and close contacts Covid restrictions to ease further in both states from Friday, with Victoria confident it has reached peak of Omicron wave Household contacts of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Victoria and New South Wales will no longer be required to isolate, with both states announcing a significant easing of restrictions from the end of the week. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced on Wednesday that from 6pm on Friday, those who live with positive cases or are deemed close contacts will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, provided they do not have symptoms. They will need to undertake daily rapid antigen tests, wear masks indoors, avoid contact with elderly and immunocompromised people and work from home where possible. They will also be unable to visit high-risk settings such as aged care homes, hospitals, disability and correctional facilities unless an exemption applies. Perrottet also announced that public health orders requiring key workplaces to be vaccinated will be lifted, and based instead on risk assessments under occupational work health and safety rules. Orders requiring aged care and disability workers to be vaccinated will remain in force, however. From 30 April, unvaccinated international travellers arriving in NSW will not be required to undertake hotel quarantine. “This is not the end of the pandemic. We will always tailor our restrictions – as we have said from the outset over the last two years – to the circumstances that we find ourselves in,” Perrottet said. “But today is a day where the people of our state in NSW can be incredibly proud. We have had an incredibly low death rate, we have put downward pressure on our health system and that is because of the efforts and sacrifice people have made.” In Victoria, the health minister, Martin Foley, announced close contacts will no longer have to quarantine, provided they wear a mask indoors, avoid sensitive settings such as hospitals and aged care homes, and undertake five negative rapid antigen tests over the seven-day period. Under the new restrictions, which come into effect from 11.59pm on Friday, patrons no longer need to show proof of their vaccination status to enter hospitality or entertainment venues, and check-in QR codes will no longer be required anywhere. Masks will only be required on public transport, in taxis and rideshares, at airports and in health, aged care and justice setttings. Quarantine will also be scrapped for unvaccinated international arrivals, with the recently opened purpose-built $200m quarantine facility in Mickleham to largely be used for Covid-positive people who cannot safely isolate at home. Unlike NSW, existing vaccination mandates for workers will remain in Victoria. Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said authorities would work with individual industries in the coming months to “transition” away from mandates. He said Wednesday’s announcement was possible due to the state’s high vaccination rate – about 95% of Victorians aged 16 and older are double vaccinated, while 66% have had three doses. “Today is a significant day for all Victorians – not a wholesale change, but an appropriate next step in this phase of the management of the pandemic,” he said. “From Saturday, it will absolutely focus more on the individual discretion of all of us in the community to make appropriate choices.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  Sutton was confident the state had reached the peak of its latest Omicron outbreak, despite a slight jump in case numbers. Victoria recorded 14 deaths and 10,628 new infections on Wednesday, while NSW recorded 15 deaths and 15,414 cases. “Today’s a blip; I think people defer their RAT tests and their PCR tests while they’re on holiday. NSW has had the same blip today, but I think that will smooth out over the next few days and we’ll see this plateau phase,” Sutton said. “But it’ll be a long tail and a slow decline, we’re not going to see a dramatic drop in numbers.” He did not anticipate changes to close contact rules would lead to a spike in new infections. “It’s not going to be a big driver of case numbers,” Sutton said. “But we need the compliance and people to follow suit.”"

            SC stays NRB governor's suspension
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 The Supreme Court today issued a short-term stay order against the suspension of Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari. The apex court also issued a show cause notice to the government and asked both sides to present their arguments in the next hearing on April 26 when the court would decide whether or not the interim order should be issued against the suspension of Adhikari. Adhikari had filed a writ petition at the SC on Sunday demanding his reinstatement and had challenged the government's decision to form a three-member committee to initiate a probe against him. The Nepal Rastra Bank Act stipulates that the governor or any official of the NRB shall be automatically suspended once the government launches an investigation against them. Adhikari argued in his petition that the government decided to form a three-member probe committee against him without proving or levelling any charge of inefficiency against him. He stated that the decision to form a three-member committee was wrong also because one of the members of the committee - former justice of SC Purushottam Bhandari - was related to Finance Minister Janardan Sharma. The government formed the three-member probe committee blaming Adhikari for the current economic mess. His lawyers, however, argued that Adhikari had offered suggestions to the government to overcome the crisis, but the government ignored his suggestions, leading to the current economic crisis. They also claimed that Adhikari had urged the government to control rising import, but to no avail. Adhikari claims that finance minister's action against him was influenced by his decision to freeze the account of a business person who had sent almost Rs 400 million from the United States without any known source of income. A single bench of Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal issued the stay order."

            CEC Thapaliya decries weakening poll integrity as undemocratic
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya today said the tendency of weakening election integrity and contaminating poll-related activities could not be democratic. Initiatives have been taken to create conducive environment for holding the May 13 local election in a fair, fearless and disciplined way and such efforts should not be doubted, he said at an event organised today here by the Election Commission. The programme was supported by the Press Council Nepal and the Federation of Nepali Journalists. ""It feels that there have somehow been difficulties in carrying out electoral reforms effectively due to the culture of not entertaining changes and taking them personally,"" he said. Electoral reforms have been implemented only after discussion with stakeholders, he clarified. ""We have decided to organise the local poll in a single phase and on a single day. Elections after 1991 have not been held in a single phase and a single day. This could result in organising the poll in a fair, free, impartial way."" He explained, the EC took the risk of allocating election symbols to the parties except those with national recognition to pave the way for them to participate in the election despite a clear legal provision to this effect missing. ""The decision was new for us (the EC team)."" According to the Chief Election Commissioner, political parties have been advised that the implementation of the Article 38 (4) that provides women the right to participate in all bodies of the state on the basis of the principle of proportional inclusion and Article 42 which is about the right to social justice would help enhance women's representation, participation and inclusion in the election. Stating that election was becoming extravagant and the poll ran the risk of being influenced by money and resources instead of party principles and ideologies, he said the EC had fixed a ceiling for election expenditure for the same reason. He said the Election Code of Conduct was drafted acting on the suggestions from all bodies concerned as the EC hoped to see its effective implementation. ""Its monitoring will be carried out through the participation of all bodies concerned. Acknowledging the contribution of media in taking the nation towards the election process, he urged mediapersons to fully comply with journalists' code of conduct and election code of conduct. ""Media houses are expected to prove their professionalism, credibility, independence, fearlessness and to fulfil their responsibility towards citizens."" It has been proposed to ban the supply and consumption of alcoholic products during the electoral silence period to avert any untoward influence among voters, according to Thapaliya. Council Chairperson Bal Krishna Basnet urged the media to fully abide by the journalists' code of conduct and election code of conduct. He said, ""It is the responsibility of all to follow the code of conduct. Media should play its role in covering the election in a free and fearless environment."" Similarly, FNJ President Bipul Pokharel opined that the media should play a significant role in taking voters to polling stations and helping to hold the election in a fearless manner. Pokharel further said that journalists should actively show their neutrality during the poll. On the occasion, an orientation on the issue of election code of conduct and news dissemination was given to photo journalists, online media journalists and journalists writing on election. Under-Secretary of the EC, Kamal Bhattarai, gave a presentation on the 'Election Code of Conduct-2022 Implementation and Collaboration with Photo Journalists'. Similarly, photo journalist Bikas Rauniyar gave a presentation on 'Photo Journalism: Past and Future' and photo journalist Bikas Karki on 'Election related News Collection, Reporting and Photo Journalism'. Likewise, senior journalist Hari Bahadur Thapa presented a working paper on 'Election related News Collection and Reporting', EC Under-secretary Surya Prasad Aryal presented on 'Election Code of Conduct-2022 and media sector' and media expert Kiran Chapagain on 'Prevention of Misinformation and Hate Speech and its possible impacts on election'.

""There remains a high risk of fake news during such time. So, carefulness is needed prior to disseminating every news and every media house should ask its journalists to remain cautious regarding this issue,"" Basnet said. Saying there were chances for the production of sponsored news from within the country and abroad, he suggested that the Nepali media consider this before disseminating such content. Basnet was speaking at a one-day orientation organised by Press Council Nepal and Federation of Nepali Journalists today. Every journalist should protect himself or herself from misinformation, disinformation and fake news, according to Basnet. The press can become strong only through credibility and mediapersons themselves should unite to maintain credibility, Basnet added. The Election Commission has entrusted the Council to carry out the task of media monitoring of media code of conduct during the time of election.

            Where it takes three days to complete voting process
         HUMLA, APRIL 19 Locals at Maspur of Tajakot Rural Municipality in Humla are compelled to spend three days to reach the voting centre. Locals said they would not cast their ballot as the voting centre was very far from their village. The voting centre for villagers of Maspur was fixed at Kailash Basic Level School which is a day's walk for the villagers. The villagers said they had to spend a whole day to reach the voting centre, another one day to cast the ballot and one day to return home. The population of the village is 103 from 23 households. There are as many as ten people above 60 years in the village. According to the ward office, the authority concerned paid no attention even though the District Election Office and administration office were informed about the problem faced by villagers due to lack of voting centre in the nearby area. Seventy-year-old Jyokhya Budha at the village said that he could not take part in voting as the voting centre was very far from his village. He said there was no one to carry him to the voting centre and he did not have strength to reach the voting centre by himself. ""I am deprived of a basic right due to this reason,"" he said. He added that he had not taken part in the previous local, province and federal elections for the same reason. Similarly, Aause Rokaya, 82, and Aakha Damai, 73, among others, were deprived of voting rights. Most of the villagers do not have voters Identity Card. Tek Bahadur Rokaya, a local, said that the ID card had no meaning as the voting centre was very far from the village. A non-gazetted Officer at District Election Office, Humla, Shyam Bahadur Rana said that the office had no plan to add an election centre. He said a voting centre was essential for villagers as the voting centre was very far away. Humla Chief District Officer Sita Pariyar said the voters of Maspur have to spend more than ten hours to reach the voting centre. She said that ministry, election office and concerned departments were informed and had taken the initiative regarding this. She added that it depended on the centre to establish a voting centre in Maspur. Information Officer at the election office Surya Prasad Aryal said that his office had yet to inform about this. He said voting centres were changed as per the recommendation of the district committee last year. ""It is impossible to establish a voting centre as the election is near,"" he added. He said that the voting centre could be established for villagers in the next election. Locals said they had demanded a voting centre long back. They said they had to carry food materials to cast vote. The state has paid no attention to the remote area. Pregnant women and elderly citizens, among others, would not take part in the election.

            IMF says any loan to Sri Lanka requires debt sustainability
         WASHINGTON, APRIL 20 The International Monetary Fund said discussions with Sri Lanka on a potential IMF loan program are at an early stage and any deal would require ""adequate assurances"" that the island country's debts can be put on a sustainable path. In a statement emailed to Reuters, IMF Sri Lanka Mission Chief Masahiro Nozaki said that IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva discussed lending options and policy plans with a Sri Lankan delegation on Tuesday. ""An IMF-supported program should be designed to resolve Sri Lanka's acute balance of payments problems and put the economy back on a sustainable growth path as early as possible,"" Nozaki said. The statement came after protests in response to shortages of fuel and other essentials turned deadly on Tuesday and Sri Lanka's Finance Minister formally asked the Fund for a Rapid Financing Instrument loan for countries needing urgent balance-of-payments support. Read full story Nozaki said the IMF is ""very concerned about the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka and hardships suffered by the people, especially the poor and vulnerable."" But he noted that IMF staff had determined last month in an annual economic review that Sri Lanka's public debt was unsustainable, and the country needs to take steps to restore debt sustainability prior to any IMF lending, including the emergency Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). Such restoration of debt sustainability typically requires a restructuring or reprofiling of public debts, which in Sri Lanka's case would require cooperation from China, one of its largest bilateral creditors. The IMF used the low-conditionality RFI loans extensively to assist countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and has provided such loans to ease balance of payments problems after natural disasters, conflicts and commodity price shocks. ""These considerations would need to be examined for a potential RFI for Sri Lanka, once adequate assurances are obtained that debt sustainability will be resolved,"" Nozaki said. He added that the specific design of a Sri Lanka IMF loan, including program targets and conditionality, would be agreed through extensive discussions between the government and IMF staff. ""The discussions are still at an early stage,"" Nozaki said."

         KATHMANDU, APRIL 14 Ambassador of Canada to Nepal Cameron MacKay presented his credentials to President Bidhya Devi Bhandari recently. Ambassador MacKay, who first visited Nepal 30 years ago as a backpacker, is delighted as he now has the opportunity to represent his country in Nepal. Ram Kumar Kamat of The Himalayan Times talked to Ambassador MacKay regarding the issues of the Nepal-Canada relations and prospects of growth in bilateral relations between the countries in the future. Excerpts: HOW IS THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS? Canada and Nepal share same priorities. We both are democracies and we stand for rules-based international order. We also have our shared priority of human rights. Our votes in the United Nations recently on the Russian invasion of Ukraine reflects our shared viewpoints. This reflects our shared viewpoints on international issues. We established our diplomatic relations in 1965 and our relations have always remained amicable and cordial. We started developing cooperation with Nepal since 1970. Initially, we had provided 900 million dollars under the development cooperation. And that funding has now reached 40 million dollars annually. During the COV- ID-19 pandemic, we tried our best to help Nepal. We provided assistance from vaccines to PPEs and ventilators to Nepal. HOW HAS CANADA ASSISTED NEPAL'S RECONSTRUCTION BID IN THE AFTERMATH OF 2015 EARTHQUAKE? Our government reacted soon after the earthquake and sent disaster relief materials worth 27 million dollars to Nepal. What's important was that Canada came with assistance immediately after the quake hit Nepal. HOW CAN NEPAL AND CANADA BENEFIT FROM TRADE AND INVESTMENT COOPERATION? THERE IS VERY LITTLE TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES? IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF ENHANCING TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND IF YES, WHICH AREAS? Our bilateral trade amounted to approximately $75 million in 2021. There are plenty of opportunities to grow this relationship across a number of key sectors, including civil aviation, urban infrastructure, Information and communications technology, clean technology (hydropower and alternative energy generation, water and wastewater, etc.) agriculture and agrifood, and education. In February 2022, Canada and Nepal held a virtual series on dams and hydro industry.The Canadian Embassy led a delegation of 15 Canadian companies and showcased the expertise of Canadian hydro consultants, equipment manufacturers and instrumentation capabilities for Nepal hydro industry. In April 2022, six Canadian companies participated in the Himalayan Hydro Expo in Kathmandu. In March 2021, the Embassy of Canada conducted a virtual Canada-Nepal Dam and Hydro Session that saw the participation of nine Canadian companies. In January 2019, the first Nepal-Canada Sustainable Hydro Workshop was organised in Kathmandu. Several Canadian companies have been active in the Asian Development Bank and hydro projects funded by the World Bank in Nepal. These include Hatch, Stantec, SNC Lavalin and Manitoba Hydro International. We would like to increase our trade and investment. At present, the trade between the two countries amounts to $75 million annually. Canada works with a representative from the Nepalese business community to facilitate business partnerships. Canada has also planned several business missions for the coming year. Canadian tourists also contribute in Nepal's economy. Before the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, around 17,000 Canadian tourists visited Nepal annually. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was the decline in the number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal. My effort will be to at least maintain the rate of tourist arrivals in Nepal from Canada like that of the pre-COVID era. WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL OF YOUR COUNTRY'S COOPERATION IN NEPAL'S HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT? Canada has considerable expertise in developing hydroelectricity. While Nepal has huge potential of hydropower generation, Canada has good expertise in hydel sector. We can help Nepal expand its hydel capacity. We will also encourage Nepal to exports its agro-products. There are 15,000 Nepali diaspora in Canada and I think that they can also help promote trade and investment relations between the two countries. IN EDUCATION SECTOR HOW CAN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOSTER THEIR COOPERATION? There has been a 335 per cent increase in Nepali students studying in Canada since 2015 (1,175 Nepali students as of December 2019). Since 2021, Nepal is eligibility to benefit from the Study in Canada Scholarships program for short-term academic exchanges. I think every year around 2,000 Nepali students come to Canada to pursue higher studies. STUDENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THEY WERE FACING HASSLES IN GETTING VISA FOR CANADA. HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS? During the COVID-19 pandemic, our staff had to work from home which led to huge backlog globally. But we are improving the situation. It will take some time before we catch up with the normal schedule. YOU EXPRESSED YOUR HAPPINESS FOR VOTING IN FAVOUR OF UKRAINIAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AT THE UN. HOW DO YOU ASSESS NEPAL'S OTHER ENGAGEMENTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL FORA? As a member of the UN, Canada wants to coordinate with other countries to defend rules-based international order. Nepal is a growing democracy and neither Nepal nor Canada is great power. Rather both Canada and Nepal are surrounded by great powers. I think we have to coordinate our responses to ensure that great powers follow the rules. A version of this article appears in the print on April 15, 2022, of The Himalayan Times"

            Five-party alliance for safeguarding democracy: Paudel
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Senior leader of Nepali Congress Ramchandra Paudel has said that the five-party alliance was formed to safeguard democracy and institutionalise changes. Speaking at a programme organised on the 53rd establishment day of Nepal Students Union, the student wing of the NC, here today, Paudel opined, ""The alliance was formed not for power, but for promoting a system, instead. The alliance was not forged to make Sher Bahadur Deuba the prime minister, it was to protect democracy and the changes in the country."" He said that the NSU was born when the then king Mahendra had imposed tyrannical rule by dissolving the Parliament and it played a significant role in taking the nation towards the democratic path, insisting on giving full shape to the NSU central working committee soon. Paudel, who is also the founding member of the NSU, called for taking the organisation to the village and school level to increase the number of members and further consolidate the NSU. NC Vice-president Dhanraj Gurung lauded the role of NSU in Nepali politics and stressed the need to take the organisation ahead as the guardian institute of students. NC General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma claimed that the incumbent coalition government was formed for the protection of constitution and its alliance for the local poll was the need of time. Stating that the NC would be strong only when the NSU was strengthened, NC Joint General Secretary Badri Pandey stressed the need to consolidate the organisation. NC Spokesperson and central member Prakash Sharan Mahat said the NSU, which carried the party's history should follow democratic procedure, culture, and system. Similarly, NC central member and Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand pointed out the need of NSU's 'big role' in the country's democratic movements. ""NC becomes stronger when the NSU gets consolidated. Republican, democratic norms and values and press freedom get strong when the NC is strengthened."" Similarly, NSU President Dujang Sherpa, chairperson of the ANNISU Pancha Singh and chairperson of the All Nepal National Free Students Union (Unified Socialist), Sudesh Parajuli stressed the need for all student organisations to come together to cut through challenges in student movements while safeguarding democracy and constitution. Chairperson of the student council for the College of Biomedical Engineering and Applied Sciences Dipraj Budhathoki defected to the NC. NC Vice-president Gurung and General Secretary Sharma welcomed him. A version of this article appears in the print on April 20, 2022, of The Himalayan Times"

            Conspiracy afoot to break coalition: PM
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba today said that a conspiracy was being hatched to break the current ruling coalition. Addressing a programme organised on the occasion of the 53rd anniversary of Nepal Student Union, the student wing of the Nepali Congress, the PM said that efforts should be made to keep the coalition intact. "" I am of the view that this coalition should not break at any cost,"" the PM added. PM Deuba said that the NC benefited from the alliance as it had got chief ministers and ministers in most of the provinces. ""I feel that I have done good work for the party,"" he added. The PM said that due to the kind of electoral system the new constitution had adopted, no single party was in a position to win simple majority. He said give and take was a natural thing in a coalition rule. Other coalition partners have accepted that we being the largest partner will have more (seats) but they also have the right to demand as per their strength, Deuba added. He further said If the current coalition fell apart, NC leaders and cadres would feel insecure. ""During the KP Sharma Oli-led government, our cadres across the country were terrorised by the government and they wanted us to change the government and that was the reason we dislodged Oli from power,"" Deuba said. He advised student leaders to be excellent in both study and student politics. If you cannot win elections in colleges, you cannot win other elections,"" Deuba added. He asked party's student wing to go to villages and schools to increase party's influence. The PM said he was confidence that no force would defeat the party in the upcoming elections provided it stayed united.

            Local reps must quit to contest polls
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 The Supreme Court has quashed a writ petition filed by Chairperson of Helambu Rural Municipality of Sindhupalchowk Nima Gyaljen Sherpa challenging election code of conduct that requires sitting local representatives to resign if they want to contest upcoming elections. A division bench of Justices Tej Bahadur KC and Til Prasad Shrestha quashed Sherpa's petition. The apex court is yet to release the full text of the verdict. The petitioner had argued that the poll code's provision requiring local representatives to resign before filing nomination for local polls slated for May 13 was unlawful and contradictory because provincial and federal members of the executive were not required to resign before filing nomination papers. The EC had argued that the said code was meant to create a level playing field for all candidates. Spokesperson for the SC Bimal Poudel said that quashing of the writ petition meant that the poll code issued by the Election Commission would now be enforced. SC's decision to quash Sherpa's petition means that the local representatives will now have to resign before filing nomination papers if they want to contest elections. The commission has set April 24 and 25 as nomination filing dates. On March 22, the Supreme Court had issued a short-term interim order against the new election code that requires local representatives who want to contest in the upcoming civic polls to resign before filing nomination papers. May 13 civil polls will elect more than 40,000 representatives in 753 local levels. A version of this article appears in the print on April 20, 2022, of The Himalayan Times"

            Melamchi water for valley residents from Sunday
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 16 The Melamchi River water reached Sundarijal, Kathmandu-based storage system, at around10:00pm on Monday. The storage facility, which will be filled in the next few days, will start distribution of the water inside Kathmandu valley from April 24. Melamchi Water Supply Development Board authorities said the water would be sent to the purification centre at Sundarijal in a few days. The Melamchi River water reached Sundarijal, Kathmandu-based storage system at around 10:00pm last night. The storage facility, which will be filled in the next few days, will start distribution of the water inside Kathmandu valley from April 24 onwards. Melamchi Water Supply Development Board authorities said that water was visible at the washing channel last night, which meant that the Melamchi water had arrived at Sundarijal. The first flow of the water was used to clear possible debris collected inside the tunnel which was closed since June 15 last year. The water used to clean the tunnel was drained into the Bagmati River, which saw increased water level this morning. After draining the water into the river, the water was channelled to the storage facility. It will now be sent to the purification centre at Sundarijal in a few days. The ill-fated Melamchi project came to a halt after coming into operation for around a month. On the same day MWSDB's authorities closed the main door at the head works, there was massive flooding in the head work area of the project around 30 kilometres uphill of Melamchi Bazaar. Luckily, the closed iron door stopped the debris and mud flowing inside the tunnel. However, the head work area of around 200 square metres was covered by up by 20 feet high stone pebbles and mud. It was only around a month that the project had started. The authorities later found it impossible to remove the mountain of debris collected at the head works, especially since the flood had washed away the road and multiple bridges to the head work. However, engineers and authorities have channelled water inside the tunnel through alternate means by directly flowing the river water into the tunnel. Without proper head works, there remains a threat that floods or debris could easily enter the tunnel further damaging it. Approximately 23 years after the inauguration of Melamchi Drinking Water Project, authorities had tested the water on 28 March 2021 and Kathmanduites had been able to get water supply to their homes for the first time. Soon the project had started supplying 170 million litres of water per day. But, it is not sure if the project can operate in the same capacity now.

            UML rival factions in war of words
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 16 Leaders of the CPN-UML faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal and those in party Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's camp today continued their diatribe against each other. While the PM said he would take action against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction if they went ahead with their planned national cadres meet scheduled to begin tomorrow, the rival faction said it would not be cowed down by the PM's threat and would hold the meeting as planned. The Nepal-Khanal faction, which boycotted a tea reception hosted by Oli today, orgainsed a press conference here and said that the Oli faction needed to rescind its March 12 decisions if it wanted to keep party unity intact. On March 12, Oli called a special meeting of the party's Central Committee and unilaterally amended the party statute and divested leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction of key responsibilities. Surendra Prasad Pandey of the Nepal-Khanal faction said at the press conference that Oli was trying to split the party by not keeping party committees intact as they were before the merger between the UML and CPN-MC. ""If Oli rescinds his March 12 decisions, then that can be the basis of party unity,"" Pandey said. He criticised the PM for acting against the party's rules and statute. ""First, Oli disintegrated the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and now he is trying to break the UML,"" he added. Lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai said the PM used the language of threat against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction and cadres but they were ready to face action for their cause. Bishnu Rijal said the Nepal-Khanal faction was all set to hold the two-day national cadres meet where around 2,000 leaders and cadres representing all wings of the party would take part. He said a concept paper would be presented in the meeting and it would be passed incorporating suggestions of the participants. A press release issued at the press conference stated that the national cadres' meet was aimed at ending Oli's monopoly and protecting the norms of people's multi-party democracy. Meanwhile, Oli spoke in a similar vein against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction at a tea reception organised at Baluwatar. He accused Nepal and Khanal, who did not attend the tea party, of anti-party activities. He said the Nepal-Khanal faction was defying party rules by deciding to organise a national cadres meeting. ""They did not attend the tea reception. I hear that they are going to organise a national cadres meet tomorrow where they will also pass a report. I can no longer tolerate anti-party activities,"" Oli said. Khanal and Nepal had aligned with CPN-MC Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal before the nullification of the NCP (NCP) and had sought the PM's resignation. They had vehemently opposed Oli's decision to dissolve the House of Representatives, which was eventually reinstated by the Supreme Court last month. The Nepal-Dahal faction of the NCP had removed Oli as party co-chair and sacked him even from the party's general membership. Later, the Supreme Court nullified the NCP and revived CPN-UML and CPN-MC.A version of this article appears in the print on March 17, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

         KATHMANDU, MARCH 26 Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who chairs CPN-UML, today told the UML's parliamentary party that he would not rescind the March 12 decision to amend the party's statute and induct 23 former Maoist leaders in the party's central committee. The rival faction of the party led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal had claimed that those decisions violated the party's statute, but Oli said they were taken by valid party bodies. UML lawmakers from the rival faction had boycotted the parliamentary party meeting held on March 18 and 20, but most of them attended today's meeting and challenged Oli's March 12 decision. Lawmaker Jeevan Ram Shrestha told mediapersons that Khanal raised the concerns of lawmakers close to Nepal and Khanal. Khanal told Oli that to keep the party intact he should revive all the party committees that existed before the UML's merger with the CPN-Maoist Centre. UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai told mediapersons that Oli denounced the clarification letter submitted by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Bhim Bahadur Rawal and threatened punitive action against them. Both stayed away from the parliamentary meeting today as well. ""The next central committee meeting will decide the punitive action Nepal and Rawal might face,"" Bhattarai said. Oli said Ghanashyam Bhusal and Surendra Prasad Pandey would furnish a better explanation than Nepal and Rawal. Bhusal and Pandey were also told to furnish an explanation for anti-party activities. According to UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai, the PM said he was ready to listen to personal grievances of party lawmakers, but would not tolerate factionalism within the party. Oli said the House of Representatives would be prorogued soon as the government was preparing to call the budget session in April. Minister of Finance Bishnu Prasad Paudel asked party lawmakers to submit their development project plans for the new fiscal budget. Meanwhile, the Nepal-Khanal faction, which had sided with Pushpa Kamal Dahal in the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), held its central committee meeting here today and decided to fight against Oli from within the party. Raghuji Panta said 60 central committee members, mainly from around Kathmandu valley, took part in the central committee meeting and decided to continue to fight for their cause from within the party. ""We have decided to fight for our cause from within the party to make UML a strong and dynamic party that follows party rules and norms,"" Panta added.A version of this article appears in the print on March 27, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

         KATHMANDU, MARCH 31 Chief Whip of CPN-Maoist Centre Dev Prasad Gurung today said in the House of Representatives that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli must seek a vote of confidence by April 5. He said the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within one month of the Supreme Court's verdict that annulled unification between the CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre. A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Kumar Regmi had on March 7 annulled the unification of the two left parties. Speaking in the HoR today, Gurung said that as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution, the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within a month of the SC verdict nullifying the unification of the CPN-UML and the CPN-MC. He said if the government sought a vote of confidence within 30 days of the SC verdict, it would be considered legal, otherwise questions about the legality of the government would be raised. Article 100 (2) states that in case the prime minister's party splits or a coalition partner withdraws support, the PM should seek a vote of confidence within 30 days. He said the Oli-led government was a caretaker government, whether the PM agreed or not. Gurung said on February 23, the Supreme Court reinstated only the HoR, not the government. He said whenever the House was dissolved, the government of the day became a caretaker government. Gurung said the government was not giving business to the Parliament to prove that the PM was right in dissolving the HoR. ""The PM still seems to be trying to dissolve the House of Representatives. The government has not accepted the Supreme Court's verdict that reinstated the HoR,"" Gurung said. He said the government wanted snap polls, but the constitution had stipulated that the government should complete five years. The SC in its February 23 ruling had said the government must run for five years and the HoR could be dissolved only when the HoR failed to give a new government. A version of this article appears in the print on April 1, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

Among those sued by the anti-graft body include rural municipality Chairperson Govinda Bahadur Khadka, Chief Administrative Officer Raju Prasad Neupane, accountant Durga Bahadur Dimdong, proprietor of Kathmandu-based Pike Construction Pvt Ltd., and 21 officials of various electrification users' committees. According to the CIAA, rural municipality chairperson Khadka in cahoots with other defendants had procured construction materials and equipment for electrification in the wards 1, 4 and 5 of the local level without inviting tenders. He unilaterally formed electrification users' committee at each ward to serve himself in misusing the state fund. It has also been found that Khadka did not even conduct a technical audit of the electrification. The construction materials were procured from the Pike Construction Pvt Ltd directly in contravention of the existing Public Procurement Act and Rule. As per the law, any public body is required to make procurement through open competition among qualified bidders by inviting tender.

So a caution should be adopted, he said at an event organised here today on the occasion of the 53rd anniversary of the Nepal Student Union (NSU), a student wing of the NC. ""The alliance has benefited the NC. We have got chief minister and ministers in most provinces. I feel that I have done good works in the NC. The existing political alliance should not be broken at present. There is no situation wherein a single party gets majority in the poll. So it should continue.""

            Nepal's top court gives temporary reprieve to central bank governor
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Nepal's Supreme Court issued a provisional order on Tuesday putting a temporary stay on the government's suspension of the central bank governor until the next hearing, a lawyer said. Maha Prasad Adhikari was suspended on April 8 as governor of the central Nepal Rastra Bank by the government, which named his deputy the interim chief. After the ruling, he now looks set to resume work on Wednesday, tackling the Himalayan country's economic challenges, with foreign reserves hit by the slump in tourism during the pandemic and remittances also suffering. The finance ministry has not said why Adhikari was suspended, saying only a government panel would investigate the matter. Neither the central bank nor Adhikari have commented, but a government official said Adhikari had been accused of leaking sensitive financial information to the media. Adhikari filed a petition to the Supreme Court demanding an interim order against his suspension, saying it was illegal. At the end of the hearing, Judge Hari Prasad Phuyal ordered the government not to ""immediately implement the decision and to allow the petitioner to resume his work as usual"", Tikaram Bhattarai, Adhikari's lawyer, told Reuters. Adhikari was not immediately available for comment but told Nepali news outlet Kantipur online the court order had provided ""additional protection to the autonomy"" of the central bank. His lawyers said he would be able to return to the central bank on Wednesday as governor. A government spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the court order. The judge ordered both sides to be present on April 26 when the court will take a decision on whether to issue an interim order as demanded by the petitioner. ""We have challenged the legality of the government's decision to order a probe panel against the governor and I am confident that the court will give its interim order after the next hearing on April 26,"" the lawyer said."

            UML rival factions in war of words
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 16 Leaders of the CPN-UML faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal and those in party Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's camp today continued their diatribe against each other. While the PM said he would take action against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction if they went ahead with their planned national cadres meet scheduled to begin tomorrow, the rival faction said it would not be cowed down by the PM's threat and would hold the meeting as planned. The Nepal-Khanal faction, which boycotted a tea reception hosted by Oli today, orgainsed a press conference here and said that the Oli faction needed to rescind its March 12 decisions if it wanted to keep party unity intact. On March 12, Oli called a special meeting of the party's Central Committee and unilaterally amended the party statute and divested leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction of key responsibilities. Surendra Prasad Pandey of the Nepal-Khanal faction said at the press conference that Oli was trying to split the party by not keeping party committees intact as they were before the merger between the UML and CPN-MC. ""If Oli rescinds his March 12 decisions, then that can be the basis of party unity,"" Pandey said. He criticised the PM for acting against the party's rules and statute. ""First, Oli disintegrated the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and now he is trying to break the UML,"" he added. Lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai said the PM used the language of threat against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction and cadres but they were ready to face action for their cause. Bishnu Rijal said the Nepal-Khanal faction was all set to hold the two-day national cadres meet where around 2,000 leaders and cadres representing all wings of the party would take part. He said a concept paper would be presented in the meeting and it would be passed incorporating suggestions of the participants. A press release issued at the press conference stated that the national cadres' meet was aimed at ending Oli's monopoly and protecting the norms of people's multi-party democracy. Meanwhile, Oli spoke in a similar vein against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction at a tea reception organised at Baluwatar. He accused Nepal and Khanal, who did not attend the tea party, of anti-party activities. He said the Nepal-Khanal faction was defying party rules by deciding to organise a national cadres meeting. ""They did not attend the tea reception. I hear that they are going to organise a national cadres meet tomorrow where they will also pass a report. I can no longer tolerate anti-party activities,"" Oli said. Khanal and Nepal had aligned with CPN-MC Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal before the nullification of the NCP (NCP) and had sought the PM's resignation. They had vehemently opposed Oli's decision to dissolve the House of Representatives, which was eventually reinstated by the Supreme Court last month. The Nepal-Dahal faction of the NCP had removed Oli as party co-chair and sacked him even from the party's general membership. Later, the Supreme Court nullified the NCP and revived CPN-UML and CPN-MC.A version of this article appears in the print on March 17, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

            Oli firm on decision to amend UML statute
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 26 Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who chairs CPN-UML, today told the UML's parliamentary party that he would not rescind the March 12 decision to amend the party's statute and induct 23 former Maoist leaders in the party's central committee. The rival faction of the party led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal had claimed that those decisions violated the party's statute, but Oli said they were taken by valid party bodies. UML lawmakers from the rival faction had boycotted the parliamentary party meeting held on March 18 and 20, but most of them attended today's meeting and challenged Oli's March 12 decision. Lawmaker Jeevan Ram Shrestha told mediapersons that Khanal raised the concerns of lawmakers close to Nepal and Khanal. Khanal told Oli that to keep the party intact he should revive all the party committees that existed before the UML's merger with the CPN-Maoist Centre. UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai told mediapersons that Oli denounced the clarification letter submitted by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Bhim Bahadur Rawal and threatened punitive action against them. Both stayed away from the parliamentary meeting today as well. ""The next central committee meeting will decide the punitive action Nepal and Rawal might face,"" Bhattarai said. Oli said Ghanashyam Bhusal and Surendra Prasad Pandey would furnish a better explanation than Nepal and Rawal. Bhusal and Pandey were also told to furnish an explanation for anti-party activities. According to UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai, the PM said he was ready to listen to personal grievances of party lawmakers, but would not tolerate factionalism within the party. Oli said the House of Representatives would be prorogued soon as the government was preparing to call the budget session in April. Minister of Finance Bishnu Prasad Paudel asked party lawmakers to submit their development project plans for the new fiscal budget. Meanwhile, the Nepal-Khanal faction, which had sided with Pushpa Kamal Dahal in the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), held its central committee meeting here today and decided to fight against Oli from within the party. Raghuji Panta said 60 central committee members, mainly from around Kathmandu valley, took part in the central committee meeting and decided to continue to fight for their cause from within the party. ""We have decided to fight for our cause from within the party to make UML a strong and dynamic party that follows party rules and norms,"" Panta added.A version of this article appears in the print on March 27, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

            PM must seek trust vote by April 5: CPN-MC
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 31 Chief Whip of CPN-Maoist Centre Dev Prasad Gurung today said in the House of Representatives that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli must seek a vote of confidence by April 5. He said the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within one month of the Supreme Court's verdict that annulled unification between the CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre. A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Kumar Regmi had on March 7 annulled the unification of the two left parties. Speaking in the HoR today, Gurung said that as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution, the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within a month of the SC verdict nullifying the unification of the CPN-UML and the CPN-MC. He said if the government sought a vote of confidence within 30 days of the SC verdict, it would be considered legal, otherwise questions about the legality of the government would be raised. Article 100 (2) states that in case the prime minister's party splits or a coalition partner withdraws support, the PM should seek a vote of confidence within 30 days. He said the Oli-led government was a caretaker government, whether the PM agreed or not. Gurung said on February 23, the Supreme Court reinstated only the HoR, not the government. He said whenever the House was dissolved, the government of the day became a caretaker government. Gurung said the government was not giving business to the Parliament to prove that the PM was right in dissolving the HoR. ""The PM still seems to be trying to dissolve the House of Representatives. The government has not accepted the Supreme Court's verdict that reinstated the HoR,"" Gurung said. He said the government wanted snap polls, but the constitution had stipulated that the government should complete five years. The SC in its February 23 ruling had said the government must run for five years and the HoR could be dissolved only when the HoR failed to give a new government. A version of this article appears in the print on April 1, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

Among those sued by the anti-graft body include rural municipality Chairperson Govinda Bahadur Khadka, Chief Administrative Officer Raju Prasad Neupane, accountant Durga Bahadur Dimdong, proprietor of Kathmandu-based Pike Construction Pvt Ltd., and 21 officials of various electrification users' committees. According to the CIAA, rural municipality chairperson Khadka in cahoots with other defendants had procured construction materials and equipment for electrification in the wards 1, 4 and 5 of the local level without inviting tenders. He unilaterally formed electrification users' committee at each ward to serve himself in misusing the state fund. It has also been found that Khadka did not even conduct a technical audit of the electrification.

As per the law, any public body is required to make procurement through open competition among qualified bidders by inviting tender.
